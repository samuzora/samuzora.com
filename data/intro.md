Hi! Welcome to my blog! You can find my ctf writeups, vuln research posts, and
other cybersecurity-related stuff here!

I'm Lucas, a 19-year-old Singaporean currently serving in National Service. I
have a burning addiction for ctfs, and also do some web dev on the side.

I main pwn and web, and am currently learning kernel pwn, v8, and blockchain. I
currently participate with [slight_smile](https://ctftime.org/team/208726) and
[WreckTheLine](https://ctftime.org/team/57908).

Outside of playing ctfs, I also love building keyboards and listening to k-pop!
